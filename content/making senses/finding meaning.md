we want our life to mean something 
we need a reason. 

For a long time, the reason was survival. 
Now we are here surviving, 
doing much more than just surviving 
and we still need a reason. 
we can't bare being helpless 
for it doesn't make sense 
to just be here and not have hope 

hope waits around each corner, 
hope has many streams of awareness inside 
like a dice, hope has many sides, 
something is bound to land 
like a dice, the hope is cut by corners
and edges that slice it into a shape with sides 
we loose the whole picture 
the meaning is fragmented 
cut by the need for numbers, 

numbers fragment the mind 

books try and convince us
sentence by sentence building on something that makes 
logical sense they bring us along in a story, 
we read and they tell us what to think 
our thoughts become the book, and we enjoy how its presented in a way 
that our mind can lay back on a merry go round, 
to be constantly fed information into our head. 

We greatly enjoy the pleasure of being fed information. 
The sooth of the mind as it relaxes 
into a constant feed 
of what ever meets my need, 

This comes from our need to feel a part of whats happening here, 
the system of liking and watching a stream is a symptom of this need, 

The number enforces the story, 
and the story enforces the numbers 
and together we go round around around 
until the whole world is created and defined by me 
and all the power we've given make meaning 
is in the hands of this tiny phone game we're are playing, 

the only way to change the game, 
is to play the change 

We are helpless to a system, 
sure delete your social media, 
or rebel against the way its tried to control us 
how its taken away our ability to make meaning from the world, 
notice how it stops you from sharing your truth to your friends, 
notice how it keeps us participating in a formula,
notice how this participation hinders your creativity 
notice the box it has put you in 
and break free 

participate to free yourself 
participate to engage in another reason to make
