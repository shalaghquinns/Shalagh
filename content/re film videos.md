the camera paradox - when your'e doing something cool, we are pulled to want to capture it, but when we capture it it never lives up to the actual moment. And if we do find a way to capture it that makes the moment seem as cool as it was, then there is often so much effort gone into capture the moment so that it looks cool, that the actual coolness of the moment is drained.
