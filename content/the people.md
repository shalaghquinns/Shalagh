the people have taught me I can trust this world 

I am reminded every day that whatever I came to do, 
is not for me, it is for the people. 
I cannot do this alone, the people have been the #1 key to this all working out, 

the people Ive met and had in my life have helped support me 
and each have taught me that I can trust my world
