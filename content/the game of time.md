*act 1* 
*Notice the way your relationship to time shapes your experience.* 

Notice the ways the value of time is perceived through the lens of numbers 

- How the value of money shape a self, shapes the experience of the day. 
- How the feeling of a guarantee and sense of safety is something we can buy, determines the way we make sense of time. 
- Notice how the numbers of likes, shapes the things you decide to notice in your time, the photos you decide to take. The time you decide to watch back later. 
- Notice how the frame of the numbers determines the time we give to what we do. 
- Notice how the reliance on the numbers leads to a society shaping everything into the box of a numerical value. 
- Notice how the feeling of prices shapes a self of self. 

Notice the system of times effect on self
- notice how the amount of numbers creates a sense of evidence and self belief 
- noticing how a need to know the time keeps us spinning on a wheel of external validation. 
- notice how the sense of knowing the the numbers of time, keeps us relaxed. 
- Notice how the major systems in the world function on this wheel of external validation. 
- Notice how the greatest system in the world (money) is trickling down into the way we all behave, is designed to turn our time to work for something outside ourself.

Notice the time inside your self, 
- notice your a part of a pattern 
- notice the way things are adding up strangely on there own under the surface 
- notice how the time in the day has a texture
- notice the way time guides you, and surprises you
- notice how it all flows together in a bizarre rhythm 
- notice how right when you want to give up the time breaks free 
- notice how everyone's differences are coming because their perception of time, 
their perception of this moment. This moment is all of time, has within it every angle, therefore everyone created reality is through the perception of time. 
- notice how everything about you is a perception of time. 
- notice how you are the time 
- revealing a self of self 

Notice the system is designed 
to turn our time in to an outwards experience 

what has the inside of time shown you. 



i don't want to change you, 
i want to change the way this whole thing works.

our religion is money 

at first the church taught the people to give their time to god, 
then the money taught the people to give their time to numbers 

and the numbers turned to god

and we followed the numbers, 
and we trusted the numbers,
and everything on earth, 
was labeled to numbers, 
then we labeled ourselves to numbers 
and we believed in numbers of likes, 
and number of follows, 
and the journey we designed for ourself, 
was based on the numbers we would make from it.

and as long as we could have a scale to measure, 
everything made sense right? 

wrong. 
this worlds not suppose to work for you, 
we can not look to the world to make sense of it 
we are the world making sense of itself

this world is not suppose to add up like that, 
we are the creation we are the one creating this whole thing, 
its not up to the time to create this experience for us 
we cant rely on the system 
we have to rely on our self,
we have to see that we are living in our own
unknown world,
one we must accept, love, and deeply trust, 

the time is coming through us, 
as a process at each moment, 
we cannot plan our time and put it into frames 
we cannot play cool thinking our time is a form of identity
that one persons experience of time has more value than another
the there is a right way to do the time and a formula to follow. 

we can still have the clocks, 
we can still use the money, 
we can have all these systems that have created this world, 
but we can no longer use them as the primary material 
to create our world, our own world, 
which together becomes a shared reality, 
only after each person learns to take responsibility for their own experience, 
and learns not to believe their times not. product of numbers 

and this is the process. 

a process each one will go through, 
to uncover they are real here 
and not just playing a game 
we have gotten so used to playing this game of time, 
that has created an identity that we all play into at a certain extent

to remember who we are underneath the identity of time, 
will take stripping of many layers of experience 
lead each of us, 
lead through a maze 
of our internally proclaimed versions 
of the shared patterns 

The blessing is when the process is undertaken, 
and an individual decides to question their experience of time, 
an awareness begins to turn on that turns everything into an internal 
version of time.
