time is how we make sense of our world. 
time creates the structures, the systems, and the systems within the systems.

time makes all the worlds go round and grow. 
time is growing at different rates within different worlds.
time is growing at different rates within the worlds inside us 
time is happening at multiple layers at once

we are comprehending different layers of time at the same time 
we can listen to different layers of time inside us 
different time layers carry different visions
and different memories,

the memory of time, guides the vision of time 
everything we do inside comes is the vision of a memory, 
every word we tell ourself,
every direction we go, 
every conversion we have, 
everything act, 
comes from a memory of the past 
towards a vision of the future, 
time is the dance of this vision

if we follow the vision, 
creating our time around the vision 
we begin shaping our senses around the vision 
and the vision begins to make sense to us,
the way we see and make sense of the experiences, 
switches its perspective from us making sense of it 
to it making its sense to us, 
the world begins to respond like a living reflection of us

we meet the people we need to further our vision, 
we must overcome the parts the hold the vision back,
opportunities present themselves,
the doors in the world open, 

when we give time to our vision
this is the gift of time
the journey its designed to take you on, 
the world its trying to show you, 
time is hiding, 
dyeing for you to give it a try, 
to be taken on an unknown ride. 

What we face in this current time
is the time around us is shared, 
we are all working for the same system of time, 
the shared external version of time guides our way 
to make sense of our world
money, clocks and numbers, 
knowing the value of your time in a numerical way, 
planning your vision around creating a value of time 
planning your life in a way that makes sense externally, 
seeing your life as a time line
all the ways we try and know our time 

the karma of suffering on earth prevails,
we are stuck in the memory and it creates the vision forward
the memory of the time before now, 
where for centuries we struggled to meet our basic needs,
and for the first time in history, we can meet our needs,
we over met them, our imagination got carried away 
to believe we need way more than just our basic needs,
our symptom of needing more, 
comes from the disease of needing to know the time 
we are sick with our need to know, we know to much 
our thoughts think we know everything, 
and the reality is we know very little 
and this is the experience of earth, 
the search for the answer is gone, 
an embarrassing time in human history, 
of radical acceptance and humbling 
where we have to each take off the disguise, 
and gracefully admit that we have no idea 
what the hell is going on here. 

we make sense of our time with news, 
with plans, with clocks, with money, 
with conversation, with our minds, 
all day, every day, 
we perceive the layers of our time, 
based on the experience of what we can know, 
all the layers we see time through 
are external systems designed to help us to know the world, 
to maintain the collective idea that this world is something we can and should know, 

we don't know how to create plans to deal with the unknown, 
or have conversations that we doing know where they are going 
or to see with a vision, clear in our mind, thats not attached to some kind of timeline, 
thats not viewed without the considerations of numbers, or money, 
that has no reason for doing it, 
other than doing it, 
thats the reason for doing it, 
the reason for doing your life 
is to enter the process of doing your life,

when we can work for time, 
we stop spending energy wondering if we know where we are going,
and more time listening to where we are meant to go, 
when we spend more time listening, 
we learn more from our world, and are guided more strongly by our time,  
when we are given what we looked for, 
in a package we never looked for, 
we are being shown by time we don't need to plan what it looks like
when we engage in a process and learn things we never could have expected
we stop trying to figure out what the time would like to teach us
when we have a gut feeling and it shows us something 
we learn that time is living in our body, craving to be felt though 
when we see that everything that we are going through is teaching us something 
we can trust that everything is happening perfectly
when we can trust this,
it doesn't stop us from reacting, 
or taking charge, 
we don't just watch by blindly when we trust everything is happening perfectly, 
we take action we have permission to take any step forward because we can trust that if we have a vision about it its made for us in someway. 


the old ways of making sense of time, 
don't make sense any more, 
in a world where any vision can come true,
it's our time we out grew.
