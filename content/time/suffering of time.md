we rate our suffering on the basis of external experience, 
peoples life conditions, money situation, and trama, 
however there is suffering in having everything
a kind of suffer we don't know how to talk bad out because 
its so recent in human history that such large sums 
of people had have their needs mets and live in worlds 
where are  their needs are met for them 
this suburban situation is having its first time in history 

we are discovering there is a special kind of suffering in having everything given to you
when you are raised in a world that makes its senses for you 
that is designed perfectly to have everything fit together, 
we learn later one we are facing a crisis, 
because we have come so far down this road, 
and forgot what our time really was. 
We give our time to a system, 
and then forget how to create our own systems
we forget so many of the parts of life that come with life 
that come with suffering, 
and it creates a suffering, 
the problem with having no problems 

I came from a world that had all its needs met 
everything was great in my life, 
but something was always missing, 
we had enough, we had way more than enough, 
and it was never enough, 
money became this obvious disruption to the greatness of life
