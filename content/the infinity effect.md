*Before infinity* 

Before this modern world, filled with millions of possibilities and infinite ways to make and use numbers, our sphere of focus was contained into the world around us, meeting our basic needs so we could survive. Our lives were simpler, we dealt with problems we don't deal with today. We did not have the possibility to participate in infinite ways to do what we wanted with our time. 

For the first time in world history, there is the largest population in the history of earth, with the ability to do what they want with their time. Not simply put as the time is free, but we are no longer constrained to having our basic needs met. Time has opened up in to infinite options for possibility.  

*We were caught under the grips of nature, 
under the grips of war, under the grips of religion, of famine, 
and now we are caught under a new kind of grip.* 

**The grip of illusion**. As real as money seems, and as real as the things it can buy us are. Money keeps us living in money, money keeps us spending our time making money, and money can't buy what we are looking for inside. 

Our search for money is in a search for trust. We don't really want money, we want to believe we are supported for. We want to trust that what we have inside, and what we have to bring to the world, is enough to be here. When we label what we have to give to a number, we are labeling our value. We are seeing ourself through the box of that value, and planning our life around it. 

The journey I have taken in my life is to discover if I can trust the work inside coming alive. If what i have inside will support me. If i let it take me where I feel, let it be my focus, let it come out of me, give it to the world, will it support me. 

Since engaging this sense of trust 7 years ago I have been taken on a wild journey throughout the world that has taught me side of myself i needed to see to bring my vision to life.
My vision was an idea, i can trust the process of my work. This vision was meant to teach me a lesson about time. 

something i've known since before I can remember;
I came to say something to the world about time. 

The vision came when I was 23 
it told me
enjoy the process 
of learning about myself, 
in everything I do. 

and I have a gift if you can trust me 

The gift was the process and all the ways it taught me how I am holding myself back.
The process showed me all the ways I try to plan, and look good, and seek known results. 
It helped me to release my plans, and surrender, and the process brought me the most amazing people to teach me everything I needed to learn. 
The process brought me to amazing places to paint walls, it was with me in every stroke I ever made, every colour I ever choose. 
The process was with me every time i've sat outside drawing portraits, trusting the pen on the page, trusting the people I meet. 
The process was there every day for the past 7 years where I have had no plans, and just followed my body. The process came through my body
Now this is what i want to share, and continue to share.
