*there has been something in side me baking,*
*its been life times in the making,* 
*this meal that i've been craving*
*is finally ready for the saying* 

the process has been a surface game i invented to play into my inner world, and see where it would take me. This journey took me far off screen and showed me why sharing it and trying to make life real online was taking away from this inner journey. This zine was a deep question inside, if technology could be used to express creativity how would it look? This has been this game to remember. It is not an instagram account, it is an inward timeline, a reflection of my inner experience, and now my inner experience is coming outside of me. 

Ive had the feeling on the tip of my tongue, 
i just couldn't put it into words,
I had to play it out, follow an inward process, 
and it taught me everything i needed to know about time, 
at the time
all the feeling had to be felt out externally, 
I had to learn from experience, 
to go through this process for myself, 
and it showed me again and again until I finally got the message, 

I was creating this whole thing up, 
and because i created it up, 
it created itself into me, 
and if I created for my inner world, 
my inner world would show up outside, 

and this was the point of creation, 
this was what I had to remember, 
that what we created was becoming us, 
the story we tell ourselves, and the images we share, 
when we make it for others, 
when we care about the image of how it seems, 
we are taking away from our inner experience, 
and promoting a false story about our truth to our world,

This zine taught me I had to face my shadow in real life, 
and if I wanted to follow this process it was going to take me through 
darkness and hardship. 
Trusting this process 
taught me how to trust in time, 

But this taught me how to engage with where my inner world wanted to take me, 
for where the inner world wants to go has no logic, 
the only reason it takes you there is to form the logic for itself, 
so you cant have a conecpt of time to listen to it, 
because its not formed around time, 
its formed around will , and natural instinct, 




I practised learning to make my senses from the inside out, 
how to create my world from every side it asked me to, 
staying closely guided to an inner world 
to each step on the journey to climb my impossible mountain. 


the one i created from it, 
and when i got to the top and looked down I realized I didnt matter how long it took me to get there, I had arrived the whole time. 
The whole time i was at my final destination, because i took the steps in time to get there, 
the point is we have to take steps into our own time, 
to create our own value and to do so we must learn not to create from the value of others.
