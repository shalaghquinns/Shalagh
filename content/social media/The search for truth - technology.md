what technology is giving us is a direct reflection of self
we are given all the worlds we could have to reflect our truth,
in social media we are given a display of the worlds we think are true, 
the worlds we are attracted to, the ones we believe in, the sides we love, 
we follow

when technology began it was more a reflection of what technology could do, 
everything was just a display of anything, because no one knew what the internet was for 
slowly became a vessel to discover ourself through, 

the medium is a direct reflection of who we are, 
and we are a reflection of it 

the way we live our lives 
the way we connect to others 
the way we view success
the way we view our word
is through the reflection of social media 

As this reflection grow sthat we discover the truth of who we are, 
the feed gets closer and closer to the version
