share a vision inside 
it helps to live into a vision for the future
by changing the memory of it 

every move into the future, 
every decision, every action, every desire 
is a reflection of a memory, 
the path we remember to take 


we are born story tellers, 
we live into the story we tell ourselves, 
what we create outside of ourself, 
creates what we become within, 

but rather the way our world is speaking to us 
we create a different memory of the past, 
and then we live into a different future.

through learning to share a different side of an experience
we give up on my need to be approved or understood
to remember something else that technology had the power to do, 
I choose to share a mirror 
to what my inner world feels 
I don't want to get fixated by these moments to create, 
so I let them come to me, 
and when I feel something is a part of me, 
when my world mirrors itself back, 
i give share it in my timeline.
