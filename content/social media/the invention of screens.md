the way screens become popular was through cartoons,
we created these characters and stories and fell in love with them 
then slowly we started acting like them, 
like the characters in the stories we watched, 
and then slowly we became them, 
characters on screens

the screens show us what we create
reflects back into our experience 
we have created a box for us to work for 
a method and way for creativity to exists, 
we need a character, 
we need to play this game on the screen 
to be cool enough to get attention, 
from others, 
be cool enough to get attention from yourself 
to flip the reflection from the characters we became, 
all the versions we took on 
about the way it was suppose to look, 
now we invent ourself out of that 
by sharing and expressing 
a world that doesn't make sense to anyone 
but you, 
we can remember how to take 
responsibility for our life. 

response -ability 

the response ability 
is your ability to respond to your environment
to take responsibility
is to be in response to your world, 

what happens is we feel our responsibility
for this world, 
to be so far out of our hands, 
everything about the threat of humanity is so impending
from outside of us, and from systems and programs 
that are to vast to grasp, 
our worlds are pulled out side of our self, 

to take responsibility is to take 
back your own response ability 
into your own response system, 
the internal awareness that is able to comprehend what 
we are actually responsible for, 
and then to take that form of responsibility 
ability from that sphere of awareness, 
to the response ability of your surroundings,
take this part seriously, 
bring back your real world into its matter, 
by changing your responsibility, 
to its internal world,
