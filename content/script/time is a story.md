art is time 
(close up shots of art in the home shot with camera, feeling is soft and mellow)

close up shots of art, narrated
- art is a reflection of time, 
- time has a certain quality to it, and indescribable essence 
- it has a way it curves, it has a colour, a story, time has a meaning.
- art is a reflection, creation is a reflection 
- when we create with time, then our lives become a reflection of our work, our art
- when we trust in the time that we already have what we need
- then we do not work outside of time, attempting to achieve something we already are
