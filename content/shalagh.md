hello, 
my name is shalagh 
its pronounced shay- la  

I am using art to share a message about time. I am on a journey exchanging what I create for what i need in life. I offer free portraits in the street, and make money from donations. I paint walls in exchange for places to stay. I wshare that what we can trust in the journey when we follow it from inside. 

this site is an exploration of my relationship to time. It is an exploration of a concept I believe we need to revisit. I am an artist traveling the world, exchanging my art. 

The art is just the medium to express a trust in time. I trust my art will support me and take me where I need. I trust in the people meet, the portraits I create and the donations I receive. I trust my hand and the art I create will support me. 
I trust in what my inner world has to give, 
this is why i choose to create 
this is the way I choose to share it. 

It began in 2020 with a journey of painting murals with my friend 
we were lead to different people, and given the space to create 
the art spoke of the experience it spoke of the people, 
and in return we met amazing people, were fed and taken care of, 
in the end, the space was left transformed 
and everyone received 
since then i've been travelling the world 
creating and exchange

This summer Ive been travelling through Europe 
doing portraits in the streets 
I offer them for free and often receive donations 
this has worked out better then I could have every imagined 
I am given the chance to meet and connect with real people 
in real life, every day. 


I began to see how the people were the key to trust in my world 
When I travelled to Nepal I was given a cozy house over looking a lake,
I painted during the days, swam in the mornings, and met amazing people everyday 
I was given food, and allowed to paint at my leisure.
I stayed for 7 months and painted the entire hotel.
