we cannot pretend to know where someone is coming from
we cannot pretend that we come from a world that we know
we are each coming from our own entirely unique world 
and to pretend that we know whats going on 
is to play the game of known reality 
which is not the game of earth 

we did not come to earth to know anything
we came to explore, to be the thing we always were
a part of this planet, a piece of a system 
the natural spinning and rising cycles as earth 
we are not on a planet, we are a planet 
and when we remember this, 
we don't form our memory around who we are 
and all the things that came together towards what we see 
we form our reality around what we are experiencing 
in this moment through our senses 

*prescription for dreams* 
you have seen the goal, reached a target
on the essay of what you want to say.
Now you must become the teacher to yourself 
to activate the lessons learned along the way 
and continue to teach them to yourself 
each lessons deepens as you practise it, 
nobody notices 
yet you take seriously your ability to learn through yourself
this is the promise
that we are creation learning through ourself 
life is a reflection 

act on the unknown, 
act out of the awareness of your challenges 
notice what holds you back, and see past it 
remember remember remember 
there was no way you had the power to see this goal 
without holding the feeling to follow it 
you followed it all the way into nothingness 
to completely giving up on what it was 
and finding it there
