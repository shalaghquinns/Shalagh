we come from different places, 
we've created different ways to express these places in words, 
these words are a reflection of the time and space, 
where we will, how we live, what we live with, 
we've invented similar things in different places, 
and have different words, 
the words are the formula for expression of life, 
the formula we've created for us to communicate, 
yet even through different languages, the expression 
of communication remains the same, 
when we say different words, we use the same emphasis 
on words when we're angry, or loving, or happy, 
we understand, and know inherently the language of 
expression. Of subtle features, 
micro expressions, 
and art. 
There is a difference between the formula (words) and the expression (communication), 
and both exist and are pervasively intertwined, 
yet the formula express's a definition, 
and the expression doesn't need it, it exists on its own , 
yet this concept foundational to own we think, 
seeps down into other facets of our experience, 
where we attempt to control and define or 
and formulate how we express ourself. 
Its like we cant separate creativity from our mind, 
we can imagine yet that there is an imagined, 
and imagining reality, happening both at once.
