to do things before I know why. 
To act upon a feeling, a vision, and imagination inside of me, and trust it has somewhere to take me. 
To closely track me experience inside to see where to go, 
and where ever I go somehow ends up making sense why I went there. 
The more time I travel from this direction the more sense everything make to me, 
to me, literally, to me. The world starts to make sense to me instead of me trying to make sense of it. 
I become the listener the observer and my experince becomes the conversation. 
Everywhere I go it has something to teach me, to show me about hw it is connecting to my inner experinces. Nothng is forgein all is welcome, when you trust the process.
It is much more than just casually witnessing you reality go by, 
to trust in the process is to actually do something with it, and then see whee it has to take you, 
this is not a paassive exsistance, it is a persuasive one. 

We always want more, 
it is engarined in our eveoluationary pattern, 
but the key is to want more of what we have inside, rather than outside, 
they key is to want to create and design the inner world, 
stornger than we design and create the external world. 
For when we prioritize the inner worlds creaton. 
The outter creation is just a manifestation of the inner expereince 

this is what nterior design school taught me, 
how to create an experience for the person, 
it taught me hat the space around me creates the experince I am having inside, 
I turned this inside of me and found out that the experince I am having inside, 
creates the experince I am having outside of me.
