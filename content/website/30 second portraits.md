why is the art free? 

*the art i is an expression of a trust  

i trust my hand on the paper, 
I trust the people I meet
i trust in the value of what I create 

when I began offer the portraits for free 
I was able to draw much more people
and I learned people often instinctually decided to donate

I want to give you the option to define the value of the work 
I want to give you the option to have a piece of art for free 
I want to trust what i create will support me if I give it to the world

I present people with a question 
how do you define 30 seconds. 
Im not expecting an answer, 
just to asking the question
how do we value art? 

Hello Im shalagh 

Im an artist from Canada. Ive been traveling the world for years painting and exchanging my art for places to stay. This has been a process of learning to trust the work I have to give has no value that can be defined to numbers. 

gage in the process of creation,* 
*it has a journey it would like to take us on,* 
*a journey we can trust is made for us*

**The Journey of Painting**

explore my journey of world of painting the world

for a large part of my 20's I travelled the world painting murals 
in exchange for places to say. This is how I learned to trust the people 
to support my creation. Each place Ive painted is an extraction of the experience, 
and the energy that existed in the space.
