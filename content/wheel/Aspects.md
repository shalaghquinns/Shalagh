Sun and Moon

the dance of these bodies illuminates the space between earth and the cosmos. The sun gives the energy, and the moon brings it down into earthy rhythm giving on a playground to come into self and follow their destiny. 

Sun conjunct Moon: In tune with instincts and able to take the steps forward to participate readily and willingly towards ones own becoming. awaiting the space where full embodiment can stream through fluidly. Propelled by destiny, yet unable to move into this space until the instinctual knowing arises. No pretending, the patience of intuition, knowing where it belongs. 

Sun opposite Moon: The ongoing process taken up at every corner towards embodying the many layers and infinite sides with a full participation in the journey. coming to know itself through itself, and has its own internally formed perspective to deeply trust and reference through its own unfolding. Learning to come from within through outward influence, with tremendous staying power and inner understanding. Growing through defeat and built resiliency. Inward state held intact as a rainbow, nothing is clear, everything is certain. 

Sun square Moon: Self comes up against its own pattern and memory. Inward nature in conflict with personal development. Ego is strong and the predicament is unexplainable. The path is through forgiveness, letting go of pride of both placements defending their predicament. Reckoning with personal responsibly towards the path of something beyond self. Getting out of ones way, forgiving shame and creating a new road for becoming. 

Sun trine Moon: The path forward is lit, and one is willing and excited to take up the next edge of the journey. The self is grounded in approval from its environment, so it doesn't instinctually seek much deeper as it is easily caught in surface approval, which is gratifying but static. Opening to what it means to be alive by experimenting with the boundaries of  what its freedom can get away with.

Sun sextile Moon: The self is on its rightful track, and the lesson is humility. The reckoning between what personally stimulates itself with itself, and what is beyond the selfs reinforcing loop is the path towards true embodiment.Requiring
