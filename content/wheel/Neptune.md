  

Aries: 1860’s A serge to discover emerges and the sense that the old structures are becoming powerless pushes a break through to a new living future. A need to reform and advocate for change, passionately streams through as a beacon of destiny. Each one on their own journey, trampling over each other in the process. 

Taurus: 1870-80’s Earth begins to surrender to the forces of human will. Amplified growth in industry ignites new found external potential. Underneath a magical time of rebirth is occurring where we begin to see the earth a living light, alive with forces beyond what had ever been possibly imagined. 

Gemini: The world is alive with so many streams of cross current fertilization on multiple dimensions, all evolving with little known end in sight. Mental world and ideas are highly celebrated with an acceptance to innovation, but lack of commitment to any one stream. Energy begins practising the embodiment of a full dimensional being.

Cancer: Earth begins eroding the social structures and cast systems. A desire to go against the larger systems makes itself known. We witness the final grasping of security as the world we knew came to an end. 

Leo: 1920's the value of each individual surfaces and we begin to abolish the structures that deny our human experience. Championing the bold and creative imagination. Surface identities have plenty of fun hyping up the external personality and we begin seeing the self through a caricature lens.

Virgo: An intricate sensibility weaving a foundation for a world that calls the human being to grow into its truth. The failing of structures and world order crushes personal initiative, and energy begins to work under the scenes to rework the systems from underneath. Tapping into an intelligence that cannot be intimidated or disturbed by swirling contradictions. 

Libra: 1940’s-50’s A juxtaposition between the destruction of communities and the uniting of humanity under a greater current. The current of hope grows stronger as do the opposing forces. There becomes a heightening participation of the expression of individual truth and interest in the vastness of the human psyche. 

Scorpio: 50-70’s We take things to the extreme on all fronts. The world is filled with intensity and we seek to bring the light. A knowing surfaces that we need to throw off all false appearances. New depths and connection are revealed through turbulence. This truth is held in the darkness and the underbelly of a world in complete denial of its potency. 

Sag: 1970’s-80’s: The potential of a vibrant new earth begins to surface. Souls are hot on fire to grasp their own vital life force. Surface forces become further adapt at tuning human consciousness towards mechanization, and people must learn to distinguish between whats real and what is false deception. 
  
Capricorn:1980’s-1990’s truth surfacing amongst a well orchestrated distraction of forces. Sensing  through all the illusions at every corner and keeping intact a vision that is piercing through. Strong souls from major turning points in history come to uphold the truth for the creation of a new world.. 

Aquarius: 1990’20s’ Our true potential is amplified and we move through the world with every ounce of matter needed to get the job done. After mastering intelligence that serves the human ego, we have a desire to redo and realigned with nature. 

Pisces 1840’60’s The cry for the need for individuality to be heard. Counterforces proclaim that the depths of this exploration is shallow. The world is so deeply out of touch with its roots, that all matter happening on the surface feel devoid of meaning or purse, little light being shown and shared.

1st: Existence is poised on the verge of infinity, meeting life with an openness to receive it all equally. Subtle variations on experiences cleanse the doors of perceptions regularly, and we meet the moment with an immediacy and in full participation. Consciously aware of the bodies limitations to keep up with the vastness of our experience, we can be overcome by the wonders that never lived, feeling the  immeasurably limitless perspective as a faint echo. The embodiment of a living dream. 

2nd: Seeing who we are on earth and being highly reflective of the teaching we receive. Trying on different masks from similar patterns and themes to deepen our understanding of the impressions we leave. Neutralizing the impact, recognizing the pattern, and then responding through present instinct, rather than pre determined performance, shows us our internal capability. All hesitation of the moments clarity can stop us from fully executing. This is teaching us to endure a thick consistency of contradicting forces and remain on our objective task.

3rd: Becoming at one with any world we meet in a flexible, adaptable manor. We venture at our own will into the maze of opportunities, pursuing a consciousness that delights in making connections and doing justice to all sides. This ability crafts a whole new frequency that can bend in all breezes and placed in the middle of anything to enjoy the outcome. We must become totally unaware of our identity to enter into a world where nothing is alien. 

4th: Taking on the densest of gravity and learning to be a permeable vessel. To become permeable the consciousness removes itself and forms a perspective that exists as if it was not attached to the events at hand. The subconscious state remains at mercy, while the consciousness  imagines what life would be if it wasn't under such influence. Can slide into delusion - or we can empower our conscious side so the the subconscious becomes a guide that moves through the earth's profound meaning and depths, providing orientation through darkness that is too hard to fathom with the mind.

5th: We see ourself as creation, and the world as our playground for coming to selfhood. Having learnt dance with our own darkness we can alchemize the ordinary through the inner lens to reveal to others the appeal of inner world. Creation and the self circulating and deepening in a boundless process. Having little separation from the self and what is streaming through means the self can be a loving influence for all to just witness the presence. 

6th: The self is given a task and impersonally takes it up, finding the collective need meets her at every corner giving her little break. A part of us begins to question why we are doing all of this, and where do we fit into this world. This can bring resentment towards the task given at hand. To realize the impact of the work we are is doing we must remove the personal self from the matter. 

7th: The fabric of everything we experience is mirrored back relationships. These pulls, keys and karmic matches, are how we validate what is real inside and will always deepen us into the next layer. We must come up against our preferences and cultivate an impersonal non-attached stance to allow our relationships to bring us into our full potential .
  
8th: Open to digest the world fully and ready for all its currents to push us forward into full capacity. This energy takes things as far as they are acceptable with our destiny riding the waves where ever the collective is going. When placed in an open creative setting we can heighten the shared imagination and fertile capacity to its fullest. The glue for self that merges all sides and seeks to participates in all the dimensions - living for the embodiment of everybody. Without an outlet one can become externally fixated and compulsive. 

9th: We are in rhythmically in tune with the universal and the spiritual beat. Remaining central and clear to what is at hand, with an awareness that keeps our life force attuned with spirit. The rhythm takes time to cultivate, but is worth all its efforts to sync with the steadiness of our inward purpose to become a true instrument for our will. Embodying a living example, often set apart, that has truly grasped the value of universal teachings and carries the sense to awaken further with each step. 

10th: The demand for the self to show up reaches every angle and meets our central focus in each scenario. An urgency and responsibility as the spokesmen to lead by example. This task is hard to ignore and live up to so we're over shadowed by the feeling of having let others down. We are dedicating ourselves and sharping our inner knowing to carve a path that is cleared of the buzz and does not evade our scared awareness. We know what we need, and follow the steps from there towards our creative potential for concentrated and dispassion service. 

11th: We are open to possibly, seeing it all, and perceived as the once who is able to take it all the way. Given a free pass to explore and stretch into worlds and beyond. If we cannot fathom the path of our own vision we will devote ourself towards an already formed greater stream of allegiance. Total power to be the representative of the group and the spokes personal for individual initiative. Being the one to go all the way with what they believe. 

12: We live in the unknown, the surface dramas do not penetrate us, and we focus among bringing to light the darkness. The depth we are grounded inwardly, matches the amount we can bring forward into the world. There is a fine line and volatile territory riding close to madness, distortions, and seeking to disturb all surface structure. Stirring up the undercurrent can often lead to further distortions. Learning to grasp this sensitivity comes from an inward resolve that can present the missing piece of the puzzle, found by the one who searched within the murky water.
