the solar system is not random, 
everything is a part of a pattern, 
everything we experience is part of a pattern 
within another pattern
we a part of a greater system, 
and it what we do with that awareness that matters, 

we have to use this knowledge 
that we have to actually apply it to our experience, 
right now a lot of spiritually is surfacing, 
but none of it has a grounds to make sense in 
because of the greater system 
we use to make sense of everything, 
our collective perception of time, 
does not provide the roots for it to grow. 

to really embrace this whole spirit thing, 
we will have to shift collective awareness 
away from the identity time labeling game,
towards embracing our time here with more depth
