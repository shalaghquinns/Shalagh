We have developed a pattern of attempting to know the world. 

we love to plan our time, to make enough numbers, feed our tummies and make sure we have a home. That baseline pressure seeps into the way we make sense of the whole of life, creating the feeling that the more we know and gather from this experience the safer we are. 

This is a natural symptom at this point in time, for it was this outward pressure that created all the systems we form our lives around. All the ways we get our food and home and money and clothes and job and schools, all of it came from the search to know more about our world and ensure we are safe here. 

Since we arrived humans have been working to make more and more sense of the world around us.
As time rolls on we have become more advanced and better at creating everything we could have ever dreamed of.  We have gotten more efficient with our ability to know and understand which translates to being able accomplish more with our time. We have created a world with structures that promote doing and accomplishing. 

At this point in time these systems we have relied on so heavily carry a lot of uncertainty. A feeling is building that it might not matter how much we plan and rely on the safety of the world, something is fundamentally missing. 

Our way of making sense of this experience uses structures and systems that help us to plan, locate and design our day. We use clocks, money, and knowledge to design the way we relate to our experience. We have our phones and AI to answer all the questions or problems we might have. 

Is solving all these problems creating a problem? 

The ironic thing is the more that this world has increased its ability to make sense the less any of it makes sense. **This is because we have one big elephant in the room, this world doesn't make sense to us, we are the world making sense of itself.** 

We can not rely on the world to make sense to us and cannot attempt to know what is going on here to find the best way for us to fit in. When we use the world to try and make sense to us then we are neglecting the fact that we are having an experience that has never been done before. We are hoping seeking and searching for an experience's outside that can match whats going on inside. We find a song, a piece of art, a poem, a friend to temporary satisfy this feeling. It warms our heart to see that what we are going through exists in the world, but ultimately it leaves us on the hunt for more. Never finding the answer we have inside, outside.

There are many external structures we use to rely on to create our sense of whats going on here. We have money, education, books, screens and most of all we have time. We use time to create the experience we are having here. We plan and structure our days using numbers and the plans in life are surrounded by time frames. 

We cannot get rid of these systems we just need to learn how to have them, but not rely on them. In essence we need a new way of understanding time without loosing the inherent structure. 

I am curious to understand time from the inside. Creating and giving credit to the experience of time we are having inside. When we can give awareness to the experience of time happening inside us then we can learn to be pulled from the inside world to make sense of this world, rather than the outside world. Where we can turn everything we go through into the power for our own becoming.
