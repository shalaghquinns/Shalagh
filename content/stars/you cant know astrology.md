this situation is not something to be grasped 
or used to define and predict this world in a known way, 
the possibility is to transform the perception of the reality, 
and stitch a deeper meaning into our incredibly personal experience

look around, everyone is living in their 
own little universe. 
Each one of us born from this planet, 
and never left. 
everyone is in their own world,
and the space that we came from, 
is not a time, 
it is an energetic expression

we are not born on a planet, 
we are born as the planet,
and as a reflection to the 
entire experience
of this system 
of souls 

it is to obvious,
and yet to much to grasp, 
as a foundation to live from.
however it is this understanding, 
that remains at the for front of every 
experience we have with each, 
we are always meeting each other 
where we are both at in time 
cross sectioning our world 
with the outer world
all day everyday, 
and out into infinity 
but none of this matters if we can 
not give the credit to the interior experience 

giving credit is a broad turn, 
and involves shifting the lens from 
the outer world experiences
that gives credit to 
people, time, money and known good times,
and learns to give credit to an inner world that is unfolding, through, within and around these 
experiences,

when looked through the lens of the stars
with this understanding, 
we shift from defining and validating the
observable characteristics of the signs, 
and our experience
and can begin to appreciate  
layers of consciousness that are 
each playing unique roles.

to work with these layers, 
we must understand it from 
how the internal experience feels  
verses how is looks on the outside 

astrology has the ability to 
become the clock without a face 
to be a way we can see and appreciate time 
from, when we take off the face of the clock 
and notice all the gears turning together as one, 

we are approaching a time,
where the time is no longer 
making much sense 
in the way we remember it,

a clock faced world
now a memory once lived
so we hang in the abis 
with no time needed to 
fulfill the wish 










if we focus on the signs 
we are focusing on characteristics   
generalized understanding, 
when we get into the degrees, 
we get into each part of the story 
and the individual experience 
which is incredibly personal 
and impossible to generalizing into 
singlar traits, 

rather than trend forecasting, 
and chart reading, 
if we study the degrees we
gather a more intimate feeling of the 
each incredibly vast dimensions of existence 

each degree is a journey 
one must endure 
that is a piece in the greater whole
360 degrees, 
each one playing 
its own vital and unique role 
in this incredibly multidimensional place  

Because astrology exists within a system, 
and as a pattern, astrologers seek to know more about the system, 
more about the patterns and believe they can think their way into an understanding, 
the reason why I find so much interest in this practise is because it combines a system,
with the power of our imagination and creativity, 
only through this lens can we image into the experience,
we are not definitions, points in our chart, or qualities, 
we are colours, sensations, combinations, layers, 
and experiences
