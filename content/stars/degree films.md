we are beyond any identity, sensing the epic, seeing the magnitude 
Participating at full scale into the vastness beyond what anybody could imagine 
Deeply aware I have a destiny here that is a part of the whole.
it is mapped out ahead of time, it demands a-lot of me and It never lets up, so neither do we. 

I am breaking free from the way it's been done, opening a space and defying traditions.
The exception to every rule, 

I bring a clean slate forward, a side others have not met yet, 
purging, loosening, persuading, 

When I follow my power I generate friction, for I disregard that external form that everyone else rely's on, Im powered from within by my own spark.
I have guts, I have vision 
I champion the unpopular cause, 
cut from a different cloth 
think what you want about me but stay out of my way. 

**_The outer casing of the Great Pyramid being removed._**   
Candor, stark naked honesty. Getting rid of all false coverings, going for what counts. You are sharply intent upon getting at the truth and staying on the truth. Self-disclosure. An extraordinary aptitude for reality, you are the world's most direct person, willing to be seen and known unequivocally. The jackhammer treatment. Blunt, brutal, and straightforward. Devoid of charm or grace, but right on the mark, gutsy and truly incorrigible.

Aries 5 

**ARIES 5**   
**_The statue of a God worn smooth by devotees' kissing._**   
Honouring the spirit within at all costs. Insisting upon the vertical aspect in all things. You feel driven by the heart to go to any lengths to express and embody the realization of divinity. Intoxicated with the Divine, called beyond, and taken by a passion, you are dedicated and consecrated and given over. Transported into other realms. Ecstatic. A frenzy of conviction that nothing matters except the Ultimate. Swept away. Released into the Cosmos. Liberated from the wheel. And expressing the inexpressible with consummate conviction.

We have tremendous potential to live up to
feeling the pressure to do and be the best we can be 
here from a purpose 
we cant escape, we cant ignore 
we must honour ourself at all costs 

we come up against the image of spirt, 
the way its suppose to be done, 
we are breaking through the archetype 

We are sharply motivated 
we cannot be the hero, 
we cannot be above anybody, 
we are becoming everybody 
uniting with the whole, the spirt of the earth 

we can see through others 
we are not amused by the lies, 
the games and stuck patterns, 
we not not shy about letting people know.

We are accused of being to much, 
to bold, putting on to much pressure, 
this is true, 
but it is nothing 
compared to how it feels inside 
to be up against the dense 
stuck patterns of the earth 

**ARIES 6**   
**_An aquamarine in a woman's navel._**   
Sensuous pleasure, powerful passions. Body wisdom. Impulses and instincts, desires and cravings, and the festive celebration of being alive here now. You are marvelously enraptured with the senses--energetic, vital, enthusiastic, on fire. Direct and straight on. Candid and willing to release into what arises. Impressionable, suggestible, youthful. In touch and in tune with what wants to happen here, your gut conviction is fiercely strong. You feel driven to be yourself and by the need to engage with the other completely. You are the one who stands out, who makes a point of it, who is unashamed.

We are our body 
we do what it tells us
I must go with my belly 
to trust my instinct 
what she feels I feel 
where she takes us we go

our presence is compelling 
marvellously in tune 
an igniting force 
we will not inhibit our power 

it is my plesure to bring others along
to fire them up 
to let them feel as I do 
to provoke 
to spread 

I go against the cultural conventions 
What others worship 
this puts us through alot 

I go agaist the external 
to go with the current 
staying on the beam 
staying within 
staying alive to the power
just knowing that what ever we need to do 
will happen 

**ARIES 7**   
**_A double-headed eagle, the heads face in opposite directions._**   
Two completely separate identities can be lived at once. What is foremost is to be mentally prepared, vigilantly watchful, and intent upon moving straight on and not looking back. Your alter-ego, your double, your nemesis, shadow, and friend is seeing life through the rearview mirror, completely enwrapped in the diametrically opposite world to the one consciously pursued. The forefront-awareness sustains admirably and avidly its directional instinct for which way is forward from here. Your subconscious shadow-self is equally devoted to seeing, knowing, and instrumenting the backward gaze, the obstructive momentum. Living along this edge hones the sensibility, clarifies things immensely--if ever both ends are claimed, honored, and given their due. It is a challenge and an adventure to be rabidly dual, a karmic crossroads with immense struggle and conflict and power. It contains a deep-down gnawing hunger for resolution and reconciliation and integration, so elusive, so unattainable, and yet so needed and sought in the destiny-reckoning that refuses to stay split, whatever it will take to fuse the bipolar visions into unity.

one side of us moves vigorously forward 
stayed poised and on the beam of our intent 
while another is deeply aware of how the rest of the world is functioning (rear view mirror)
the other side watches to see the obstructive forces, 
the experiences getting in the way (fleeing from avalanche)

2 divergent perspectives 
both intensively focused, 
both intensively aware 

we notice, we justify, we make sense 
we integrate we understand we emphasize 
there is trama, there is wounding, there is let down,
one that heals that reconcile that conjoins 

another side opens 
we find that everything inside us was needed 
all the pervasive pros and cons exsist,
but they are no longer useful 
the land of both 
turns into the land of all 

the ends turn into the beginning 
we tune into a way of making sense of the worlds together and whole
we can see the converging 
we can link up with the mysteries 
we can love 

**ARIES 8**   
**_A lizard dressed in blue satin and pointed shoes._**   
Entertainment, spectacle, self-exteriorization. "I am a lovable object." Taking on roles for fun and frolic. Becoming everything and nothing. Identified with style and finesse. Life as a throwaway. With the desire and intention to get away with a series of extravagant ruses, you are absolutely fascinated by the extent to which nobody can catch you at your favorite game--the juicy portrayal of what everybody wants to see, devoid of conscience or ethic. The ideal amoral opportunist who is loaded with talent and is the world's best self-exploiter, to a point of a great joke or trick that becomes much more compelling than any real thing.

we see the living spirit, we become it, 
we can take it anywhere we please 
We play, we become, we try on,
we are playing on roles to become anything we want 
we futher the situation forward, 
become what is needed, 
we are impersonating ourself 
playing up on our personality 
we are weaving between worlds, the one we could be, 
the one others see, the version that meets the eye,

fooling around in spirt body,
we are becoming what the world needs from us,

allergic to to subtle, the under current, 
straying from the process, 
we want to get there now 
we will do what ever it takes to bring spirit on the ride with us 
everything is so real so visceral, 
we cant take it all so seriously, 
motived to tease at it 

if we take this to seriously we can drive others in our game, 
they become too obsessed with everything we made up.
no matter how far we take this game, 
all we are doing is experimenting, 
just to see how far we can go in the direction we please 
we are becoming many sides 

we cant concisely see why we are playing these games, 
so there can be a denial of the full truth,
if you've got the fit, flaunt it, 
be ingenious, resourceful, wildy and wacky, 
don't concern yourself with the appearance of how it seems

**Aries 11** 

we see brightly through the dark 
we see through our past, our karma, our darkness
noticing the light the shines through 
(attic)
when the world moves against us 
we are shown our strength to prevail

to take the raw experience of earth 
and learn through its many sides 

we are well equipped 
our perception clear and clever 
all the things we don't want to see 
present themselves 
we are moving from thinking and analyzing 
to feel deeply the world as a whole
(gaming world - real world)
sensing through polarity and conflict

obstacles turn to initiations
for development in the long run 
our genius cooks within 
the power to forgive us 
for everything we could not see 
so we can hold ourselves together again

**aries 12** 

we were here before 
we will be here long after 
we are the power of eternity 
the nature of timelessness 

never leaving our scantuary  
not adapting or changing 
just holding the space inside open 
the voice of life speaks through us 

as the world moves around us 
we stay the same 
never claiming it as our own 
never denying it is not us 
just remaining still 
letting the inner vibration come through 

deeply aware of the significance of all things 
clearing out false games 
for the truth is on fire 
with the dawn of a new day 

we hold the beat steady 
waiting for the balance to be restored 

watching alive and ready

aries 13 

taken by destiny 
so fast we can can only hold on 
never holding on to the past 
there is no container 
no form, nothing to hold on to 
where ever we get caught 
we're given extra power to overcome 
set of outwitting anything holding us back 
seeking a direct and straightforward path to results
yet experience many twists and turns 
we try to move away from what holds us back
seeking what sets us free 
we end up in one trap after another (doors into doors)
must learn not to try and make sense of where
instead becoming responsive to the whole pattern
of where its trying to take us 
the force of destiny seeks to scatter the old 
making room for something new (tornado) 

the past disappears and the only thing we have is the future. We have a continuously need to attempt to locate ourselves, make sense of where we're at which is a trap because it continues to change and transform us, as long as we continue to rely on making sure the destiny takes us where we think we should go, we will remain at the mercy of trying to be free from something. We must see where the pattern is trying to take us, where we have always been going, and become responsive to the whole pattern, no matter how much we get stuck we will always have the power inside and motivation to move us through.

the past disintegrates 
we are all future 
caught in the need for liberation 

we must see the whole path we've taken to escape the linear mind 
where ever we get trapped 
we have the energy and potential to push past and move through

**Aries 14** 
Profligate and prodigal, you are fertile, creative, dynamic. Full of bright ideas. Resourceful and ingenious. Carefree and careless, you concentrate on the spark of the now. Tunnel vision. Your talents and abilities extravagantly displayed. A special knack for individual genius--eccentric and a real character. Ornery. Not really listening. Self-impelled. Tuned in to interests and capacities, tuned out to everything else. You are going forward regardless: "Gotta get there," but the blind spots add up. Reckonings and conflicts. Confronted with what has been denied. Wildly unrepentant. You are the hardest one to convince, yet the one who knew it all along. The advantages and the disadvantages of taking a special angle and following it all the way no matter what.

One fire with the moment 
with our on interests and 

full with creative power 
shaking off the moment to generate new growth 
indulging our power

lacking focus 
with what happening that we face endless distractions 
greater than self, 

13- taken by destiny

15- takes everything seriously 

aware of we are distracted and knowing this provokes us to play it out further 
knowing better feeling justified to get away with it 
doing what we please while accepting the consequence 
refusing to give power to what is literal, limited and earth bound 
our instinct, desire, and drive are what form reality 
advocate for the free life, 
underneath we are aware of our weakness and suitabilities to being on earth, 
although we don't 'stay with it long enough to take seriously. 
we have a strength to move through 
the need to prove to ourself that we are above it all 
turns out to be the way we deal with our weaknesses 
we can move through our fears and develop an ability to see through all the shams and self deceiving notions. To be right there with ourself in honest conviction of our truth. 
we can outlast our weakness not to take anything seriously, so we can know what is true to take seriously. we ca learn not to get caught in distractions

**ARIES 15**   
**_A man with pointed ears._**   
Super tuned in. The personification and embodiment of what it looks like, feels like, and is like to have an inside track on everything going on around you. Uncanny awareness. You have the gift of getting across new ways of being, different ways of looking at things. Somehow getting away with being so very different that it no longer matters. Hot-wired to wild and uncomfortable truths. You have special radar for undertones and nuances, motivations and signs of what is going on underneath. The direct front row seat upon who the other is and the challenges and opportunities the other brings before you, when you are ready and eager for the encounter and you know you can always find a way to move with absolutely anything that might arise.

postive 


we take on the way the world sees us - we are so different that it can no longer matter 
(requiring those who can see our truth)
we are challenged by complications - we have an incredible ability to deal with them 
challenged by how to respond appropriately - able to find a whole new way of being 
path is clear and one pointed, marked out ahead. we know where we are going
we need to tune into ourself and own confidence - or we arent clear about whats going on 
we build our the trust in our awareness then we can show up with conviction, clairty, and passion. 
our challenge is in the outer circumstances and demilnas which we cannot make sense of, 
our ability is to meet the moment with clarity 
since all our attention is on digesting the world, 
when we can bring attention inside and not over look our needs, 
just being present to what we are going through inwardly can make us aware of how to be with the world. 

while the world and our past can seem distorted and complex, 
called to not take on the reflex of the past and to meet the moment afresh
for we can digest and find a form of clarity that brings through new ways of seeing and being. Pulled out into the world to respond candidly, we can respond on cue 
remember to stay present with the moment, working through karmic memory of incapability, we are iginighting our capability a genius inside wants to emerge, to deal with its unique contribution on the spot. gathering our inner power to not take on the worlds view of us, to stay within your own experience, balances the equation

stunningly tuned in
to the world around 
to our surroundings 
dealing with complications 
able to respond 
to find a clear direct path forward
we are presented with many complexities
we know whats going on 
we must trust this awareness 

believing in our inner power  
that knows how to respond on cue, 
we must overcome the memory 
of our previous failures
of all the ways the world sees us 
just to stay present 
within our world
to let the individual genius 
come through 

**ARIES 16**   
**_Three sculptured birds: one black marble, one white marble, one solid gold._**   
Genius. An extraordinary consciousness in a three-fold sweep of the phases of intelligence, coming into its fullest domain. At first the naive confidence in the mental powers, and in your own ability to know what everyone needs to know and do what everyone needs to do. But later on there creeps in, and always was there hovering, the terrible knowledge that you know nothing, understand even less, and are operating in the dark. This can be terrifying, but is also redemptive in radical measure. Then there comes a synthesis, a cooking up of the raw intelligence into a vital grasp of the essentials in life, and in particular of your own place in this world, with a brilliant awakening to the total design and how your own awareness is perfectly poised in the center to reflect all that is, truly.

we put ourselves through the dark 
to uncover a genius
ability to deal with whats at hand 
we discover an impressive intelligence 
rising into clear open space 
someone that knows what to do
underneath we don't know anything 
we don't know where any of this comes from 
this fear becomes redemptive 
sparking us to discover 
what creates our own intelligence 
we make use of our internal raw material 
we can ground and focus our understanding, 
bring it down to earth 

we recognize our awareness is perfectly centred  
to enact the truth of our being in the world


**ARIES 17**   
**_A bodiless head asleep on the beach._**   
Cast into exile, sworn to silence. Held to an ancient code to be a watcher, a perfect witness to the inward reverberations of all things. Outward events and experiences are gone, mean nothing here. All that counts is to sense into things, to remember the essence and to know the forgotten worlds. It is a lonely vigil, a strange destiny, with a piquant flavor of sorrow mixed with exultation. What others are happy with is far out of reach, unimaginable. Yet what so many others miss and are put off from is here vividly, vibrantly indwelled every moment, which sweetens the bitter cup and allows the greater task to be taken up with a surrendered will and a quiet, inward repose.

contemplative watching 
weaving spiders web 
witnessing connections, going on own path, 
people not seeing what you see. 
dwelling by a window 

what matters to others, 
does not matter here. What others miss is vibrantly a part of us.

a witness conciseness, 
outer event don't mean anything, all that matters is to remember 
we must dream into every situation, create it from within, 
a secret mystery arising from inside
we know what to do with the scared, the real, the primal 
we don't find where we belong in the civilization, 
we dwell outside its boarders. 
activated inwardly 
deeply inwardly sensing 
a rhythm of the future 
a feeling of the past 
seeing and perceive what others have lost track of 
they will critique your path and choices, 
the gift arrises when we can move through the judgement 
a watcher a witness, 
we are tapping a dream 
everything arrises within 
a secret mystery 
we don't know what to do with the contemporary context 
it does not motivate us, 
we dwell outside
no where to go, 
nothing to do, 
when we enter this quietness 
we are granted the power 
through harnessing our deeply contemplative nature 
when we stay in touch with the inner source 
we can keep the current alive for others 
being granted every link 
and key to uncover 
the missing places 
that are the keys to our freedom 

**ARIES 18**   
**_A jellyfish._**   
Neither being one thing nor another. No longer belonging and not yet attaining. You live in limbo and fiercely get ready. This is a very strange predicament. You have no world to be in. The past is over; the future is not yet. The present moment becomes both magical and dreadful. It is dreadful in that nothing ever really happens and you cannot stand it. It is magical in that when you have lost everything and truly have nothing left to lose, you are free. You are free to dream and free to be. You still have no context, no place to plug in. But you are a free agent. Oddly released from pressures, demands, the crossfire of urgent criticality. And in this state, you have one amazing option. If you give this away, if you surrender your sparkling autonomy to the universal life-force, you can turn the world on and make everybody aware that they are free as well.

no world to be in 
nothing to lose, activates freedom, free to dream free to be. 
released from external pressure, external demands,
