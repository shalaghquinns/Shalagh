grows though hate, 
grows through challenge, 
grows through the people 
who cannot understand this with their mind 
grows as the branches of the darkness intertwine 
my love grows with this land as my hearts set of fire, 
my love grows through your love like the voice of a choir  

love moves though me like you are the wind 
ill move for you, Ill take it in,
