a future where everyones famous
the only reason we admire fame is because it means someone came to earth, and did what nobody else could do. They did themselves and shared something we hadn't yet experienced. This is not going to be a very big deal in the future, this is the goal we aim for, a world where everyone has permission to do themselves and the world supports their growth.
