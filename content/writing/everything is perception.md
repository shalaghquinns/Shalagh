but where are the facts 
what is the evidence that can prove this. 
fact comes from science, 
science cannot fathom the existence of both
fact and perception 

we are both getting to know 
our world, 
and getting to know 
what it means 
truth is both fact and perception 

both are based on each other, 
never separate 
co existing in a dance 
to get us to grasp and 
sense into our world 

we love to search for facts 
and for our perception to understand its truth 
through facts, 
facts create structure

when we let the perception search past the facts 
a sense of truth and structure begins to arise
that has its own sense of fact, 
infact. 

Leaning to trust perception, 
craves the path of inner knowing, 
and allows us to rely less on external evidence 



when we lean to far on the facts
of the known world 
the inner perception does very little seeking 
to be satisfied. 
and when we do search for what we want to perceive,
we turn to scrolling worlds
that satisfy our perceptions desire 
without our perception actually having to imagine into it.
