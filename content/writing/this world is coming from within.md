science validates our experience 
with the proof from the external reality 
by attempting to add it up and make it all make sense 
but everything on this planet is an internal experience 
everything we experience is our individual perception. 

we can agree upon things, 
there can be a correct answer 
but even the answer 
meant something different to everyone 

it's the last thing we would acknowledge 
in a connection
but the first thing that motivates us to connect 

we are coming from our own world 
we want to share it, 
and we want to go into others worlds. 

we are all here on earth, 
on a planet that we can agree appears similar 
but it would be very unfamiliar to ever experience
this same place through someone else's world 

**everything we measure** 

we do it with numbers 
because numbers are the only way 
we can grasp consistency 
in this every changing experience, 

but we've learned to rely on the consistency 
not the ever changing environment.

numbers never change their meaning, 
yet the value we associate with them 
is always shifting, 
stretching and expanding in all directions 
just like this world 

1 is 1 
but 1 wanted some fun 
2 is 2 
but 2 had to undo 
3 is 3 
but 3 wanted to be free
4 is 4 
but 4 was becoming more 


the meaning of the numbers stay the same
an invented rating system in our mind, 
seeking to valid itself through external prof

a created the experience of 
identifying everything within a fixed system 
to add it up and make the most amount from it 

we have gone so far in this direction 
that we can't separate our identity 
from the amount of numbers we've made, 
they were co-creators.

so many problems this earth faces, 
we cant fathom, 
because of the identity they carry 
from numbers 

as much understanding 
as the numbers give 
this external reality  
its is still unfathomable 

its time 
to turn attention to the only reality 
that is real, 
the fact that 
this is your world 
your'e creating it, 
as much credit as you have given to the external experience 
for your behaviour, is the amount of credit you can give your self, 
for your ability to fathom this existence 

**you dont know anyone** 

we cannot pretend to know where someone is coming from 
we cannot pretend that we come from a world that we know 
we each come from our own entirely unique world,
and to pretend like we know what is going on 
is to play the game of known reality
which is not the game of earth

we did not come to earth 
to know why, 
we came to be the thing 
we always were 
a part of this planet 
a piece of the system 
the natural spinning 
and rising of cycles

we are not on a planet 
we are a planet 
and when we remember this
we don't form our memory around 
everything that happened 
to get us hear, 
and rather everything 
being a deepening refection 
of all thats ever been 
towards all there is to come 






the process zine 
is an art project 
about art projects







one zine 
many streams 

we are so far into the game of number validation 
when we behave from our true nature 
we seem disconnected from reality.
Those who behave in ways unaligned with the greater social currents 
are disconnected because they are connected to relms
that we have not made sense of 
we push away that which we cant make sense of 
we have attemped to create an enture society 
that makes sense to everyone
when not one person is making the same sense 
of anything 
and its not something that disconnects us, 

its the last thing we would acknowledge 
in a connection
but the first thing that motivates us to connect 
we are coming from our own world 
we want to share it, 
and we want to go into others worlds. 

we are all here on earth, 
on a planet that we can agree appears similar 
but it would be very unfamiliar to ever experience
this same place through someone else's world
