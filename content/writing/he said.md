he said you notice the patterns, 
and then you identify with it,
that is not how smart works
i thought thats how i've learnt to love, 
from the insides out,
this is spirituality, 
in a world of facts, I don't care how you see it, 
the shift is not from the outside in, 
you must learn youre youre own, 
person, 
own experience, 
made to unfold, 

i see him doing math, 
amI jealous I didn't train my brain that way, 
or am i grateful i cant work with numbers the same,
i said dror, 
I love your brain, 
but i really wanna know, does it make you insane. 
is playing sane, a part of the pain, 
or do you really like thinking that way, 
because I lost need, 
the ability to see,
how the world adds up logically, 
I left it behind, and I cant look back, 
because something about being an artist 
is so much more interesting.
am i sorry for the way i feel, 
dont let me steal the dignity , 
youve collected from thiscollectve frequency, 
is it to real for you, 
the me i cant not be, 
or can you prentend, 
and pay this game with me, 
I dont want to make sense, 
I dont want the proff
for I built this house without a roof
