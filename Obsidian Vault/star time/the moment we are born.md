our world stems from one moment, 
and since that moment 
we never left, 
since the time of our birth 
we have been living in our own entirely unique world, 
in conjunction to everyone else's entirely unique experience

if you really look at people 
you will see something amazing is happening, 
each person is in their entire own universe, 
the one moment they have been in 
since the day they were born,
the same moment 
the one they they have created, 
everything thing that they are,
stems from the moment they were created 

and in the moment of our birth 
the moment we come concious to our world 
we become one with it, 
one with the moment that we will live for the rest of our life 
and when we become one with it,
we become one with not only the world, 
but the stars and the planets that surround us. 

we become one with the current of the solar system
the stream of creation 
and from that moment we transform in relationship to our world, 

we become the experience 
and slowly merge back to the whole as we die
and in this becoming the world becomes along side us,
we work together to create something, 
and we emerge from the earth, 
just like a tree, 
with every branch, and leaf, 
and curve and root,
born from the moment 
we emerge from the darkness, 

and since then
each moment we have been creating this world
each one of us having our own create unique individual world 
yet shared with the world around them

we must come to learn from this fact, 
that each one of us is its own universe 
in its own world 
here todo its own amazing and unique job

we must give people the chance to see their birth 
for its own right, 
without any preconceived 
notions beleif systems 
ideas about what it is suppose to look like

birth is a part of a larger process,
one we can trust in, and surrender towards  
an unknown stream that has its own 
unique destiny unfoldment, 
that has never been done before
our identity is an unknown maze, 
and our time on earth is the gift we are given to explore it 

 



being born is the most creative moment we will ever experience 
for just like each moment of our life, 
it is not just the moment that creates us, 
but us that creates the moment,
and therefore this moment 
becomes the moment we create 
our life on earth, 

we can look to the stars to understand 
the pattern of creation
and by seeing ourself within it
we can learn to own the role for the internal experience 
that is speaking to us. 


the only experience we have ever had,
and never left. 
and each one of us the same, 
in an entirely different world. 
and entirely differnet experince, 
in the same world, 



everyone is having their own personal unique experince 
each one of us, forming the world, 
our knowing, our truth 
there is no fact in the nature 
nothing is truly true
everything we experince is a perception 
when we can reconize that reality is subjective 


what i want it to see like, 

birth is the experience that creates us, 
our conciseness experience 
is always in reflection to the moment we 
were created 
each person is having there own unique experince based on the time the came from
