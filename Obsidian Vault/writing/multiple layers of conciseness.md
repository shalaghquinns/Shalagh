experience is always crossing a threshold beyond what exists 
as it creates in one way, 
it simultaneously creates for another 
in another side of consciousness 

we talk about all these states of conciseness,
like we move in and out of them, 
but we don't move into an unconscious state, 
the unconscious state is always happening
at the same time
as the conscious one 
we cant shut any layer off, 
multiple states are always happening at once, 
and each one is has its own unique relationship to each other 

we are a reflection of time, 
when we study a birth chart, 
we are looking at 

the only truth
everything is a reflection of time 
no matter what, 
the experience you're having, 
is always in relationship to the last moment, 
everything, every little experience, 
is a response to everything else, 

we can have any experience here on earth
that we want to create, 
but we cant create anything real, 
without moving through every ounce of the time it takes to get anywhere, 
this is the only truth. 
except death.  

we would like to skip over time 
get to the fun part, 
we forgot how to idolize 
the fun part was the making it.
