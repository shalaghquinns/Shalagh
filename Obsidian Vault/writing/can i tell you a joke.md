sure, you say
you begin listening,
not seriously and kinda curiously 
because you know what your hearing is going to change 
because its a joke 

the punch line comes 
but the punch line was not the joke 
it was the perceived reality 
prior to the punch line 
that is the joke 

the world is a joke and
everything you experience is
has the potential to reveal  
an ironic outcome 
if you don't hold it seriously 
and listen curiously
