the time and space we came from 
we pretend that there is the prescription for all of time 
religion would give every individual  the same prescription  
for all time and space. 

we believe their is a sort of 
formula for doing human 
and we check with the external reality
on how to behave 

we celebrate and acknowledge our differences 
in appearance, and beliefs, 

(religion)
the idea that where we came from 
and our age does not determine our differences 
but 
and instead makes up a portion of our differences, 
and rather physical appearance gets more credit 
as a differences than age
