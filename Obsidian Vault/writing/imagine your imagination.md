remember its power 
when we were young 
and could get wrapped up for hours
in our invented mind,

and somewhere along the lines
we had to give over this power 
to what was real,
what was proof, 
what was good,
what was cool

we lost the ability to 
invent this place into our home

creativity is not an art practise 
it is not something we make time for 
it is never separate from any moment 
its always happening 
with each moment we make 
more and more sense of our world
we are imagining into our reality 

the experience is is racked with possibility, 
and we are suppose to choose a direction, 
we think about it logically, 
we add it up in our head,
we come up with a reason based on what we know, 
and we form our path forward based on this reason, 

we are kidding ourself, 
we do not know what we know, 
because where ever we go, 
what we know expands,





we want to keep track of this knowing, 
rationalize it, 
in the creation of the rational 
we are excluding an experience that begs 
to be heard, 






nonsense creeps through the sentences 
we're explaining to each other, 
its haunts our senses as we scroll through our phones 
attempting to grasp and integrate all these sides into our world.
we want to stand on top, be the one who knows, 
but the situation is bursting at the seems 
with the feeling that it doesn't add up 
and no one knows what they are doing here, 






and this is the truth, 
no one on earth, 
has any idea
how they ended up here. 
thats the only fact. 

we think we know what it means 
but that would mean we know what we think, 
and thoughts aren't for knowing, 
and thinking doesn't find meaning, 









we like to use our thoughts to add it up, 
but it doesn't add up in the way we think

it adds up on other layers, 
in other dimensions 
and we shant waste
what mental energy we have 
attempting to logically 
understand this world






this is a ocean 
for a creative process 
to unfold 

it has many streams 
underneath


creature degrees 
 process of 
 stars 

slowly remembering why
creation 

sleepy pigeons  
imagination

the first vol 
i tried to plan 
it taught me it wasn't tied to time 

the second vol
i tried to share 
it taught me it couldn't be explained 

the third vol 
i tried to understand 
it taught me non-sense
