what's Israel been like?

while I've been hear for just under 3 months,

and am just beginning to understand the intensity.

The truth is so complex and deeply woven into the systems and culture here. But it is not talked about, or recognized outwardly. The people seem to be facing an itch, and the itch is very real.

when I first met dror I was scared to enter water so deep. It was scary at first to see into the problems he faced being Israeli, being jewish, and being the time. But this was just the beginning. Dror's gift was his open heart to be able to welcome in all sides of the world. I realized later that this was a symptom of being exposed so many perspectives.

His active mind was very busy comprehending sides of life. Reading books, the news, checking stocks, and analyzing data. Here in Israel there are a lot of sides of life. Outwardly this is obvious, but the true differences exists in the undercurrent. There are big difference in belief systems. The worlds people come from have completely different roots, within the country and within all the surrounding countries there was different ways of seeing the world. These differences create conflict.

The more I am understanding is how all these wars stem from fights amoug religions, fights amough belief systems. We are at a point now where the fight has moved from beyond to the belief system, to the other side where we condemn anyone from condemning anyone for having a different belief system. We are all coming from different parts of the world, different belief systems and this creates a lot of problems. Yet it is a crime to recognize differences, because its like we are recognizing someone for where they came from. However, the difference does not exist between us on the outside, It comes from deep inside.

We are the world we are born into, the belief system of this space becomes deeply ingrained into our behaviour. These belief systems have developed over the years where they have grown into forms of power. Fights start as the beliefs systems take the power from the other belief systems, and each one try to gain their power back. These worlds have been flighting with as far back as it goes.

In the world I come from this is a myth, not a part of the real experience. We have no idea how to imagine that conflict would arise when different belief systems come together. Where I come from we witness a lot of harmony between our difference, everyone behvaves, there are no threats and we are protected.

I think this creates a lot of consequences within the western world. We are secluded from the effects of war and real problems in our daily lives. We cannot imagine being attacked by another country or what we would do if we were at war with our neighbours. Obviously this sounds like a good thing, however it means at the root, we don't know how to fathom real problems are happening, and we have not learned yet how to take responsibility for this real reality.

Turns our these different belief systems create conflict that are alive and ripe to eat. This place is helping me to develop a belief system for the individual experience. I hope it creates a lot of conflict with our inner worlds, I hope it helps to give rise to a new external world, through the process.
