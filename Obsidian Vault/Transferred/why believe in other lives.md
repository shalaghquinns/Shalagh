why believe in other life times..?

not all like times are meant to shine 
some are meant to stay inside
the ones that shine spent a long time 
inside before they decide to come alive

the thing that stops us from appreciating our differences, 
the trap that gets us into envy those who came to shine, 
is the illusion of time.

we think that we're suppose to do something shiny 
we give credit to the external evidence 

but some of us came to shine, 
some of us need to be alive inside, 
and some of us need to hide, 
before we're ready to claim the mine 

I came to be inside, 
but a part of me wants to shine.
