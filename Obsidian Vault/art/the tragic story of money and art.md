Today I has a classic experience where I saw a wall that looked like it could use a mural and talked to the owner. At first he's super stoked about the idea, we talk about a vision, I show him my previous work, we get the excited about the idea of the art, and then begin to talk logistics. Getting the paint? sure he can pay for it! Then i mention gently, that ive done alot of work for free, and I just cant do that anymore - I should get paid for the work. He agrees, but the entire demeanour of the conversation changes. Now things are serious, now comes the determining factor, will there even be this beautiful imaginary project if the numbers don't make sense. There comes a pause, and my partner and him start talking in Hebrew, I see the man back down saying , loh loh, the translation is no, no in english. The idea is cancelled, a number was mentioned beyond what made sense to the owner and the moments over. 

money puts the fire out on our imagination, 

the final realization 
came after so much time, 
itself had no real value, 
it was just the death that 
made me realize that from before.
that allowed me to move forward, 
but the realization was nothing 
compared to the journey 
it took me to get there. 
it was just the great joke, 
the final punch line to an experience that
had been playing itself out to me 

I asked for it 
to be chained up, 
and create my own way through, 
to become all the external world, 
I had to become the external fantasy 
to do the best i could for others to see, 
just to say fuck that joke 
im sorry i lied to you, 
I was playing a game 
thats not me, 
I am much more insane
than my outer sanity may have proclaimed, 
Im just crazy in an outer way, 
so my inner sanity can stay the same.
