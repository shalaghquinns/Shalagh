I believe we have to give more value to the time unfolding inside of us
it appears our world has found a numerical system for naming and identifying time 
into money and numbers, and this system in no way gives credit to the 
mystery seeking to unfold from within. 
we must begin the shift in our world 
through the perception of time, 
once we can recognize that we 
are ourself a product of creation, 
their are no facts, and we are a living perception, 
then we can begin to shift our values from 
relying on and cultivating external truth, 
to embodying nonsense. 
We can loosen the need to reinforce plans 
and make sure everything is right, 
when we can see that nothing was right or wrong, 
that it was all happening as a part of the creative process. 
When we can understand this and apply this to our lives 
then our we become less driven towards controlling the external processes, 
and begin to listen to the subtitles of the internal processes which allow us 
to sync with the existing flow rather than 
calculate it and consume it.
