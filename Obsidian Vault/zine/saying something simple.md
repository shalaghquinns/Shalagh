something simple that requires, dumbing down our brains, 
shutting off the knowing valve, 
and the gathering evidence to formulate a problem, 
towards become a part of the problem, its one slight shift into 
into a world that changes the perspective on every world you move through. 

The point is to change the relationship between the self and their world, 
we are born with a feeling of connectedness and then slowly become separated, 
as humanity pulls us through puberty, the humiliating stage of adopting an identity, 
and we see our world as a place to build our identity, 
everything in the world becomes a product of who we are, 
everything is a personal reflection of our identity in contrast to the world 
we have a comparative lens towards what is us, and what is not. 
we have preferences, schedules, and goals to formulate our identity into existence
the calendar calculates 

when we swap this lens, 
and turn it inward, 
then the experience outside 
ripples inwards, 
through lens of identity 
into the experience of light, of a spectrum, 
where everything is seen in its own light, 
the inward experience of a forest where everything is connected, 
and the experience outside is just a mirror to the same inner world, 
just as vast, just as timeless, and unknowable, 
yet curious, formative, and expeiencial 
the inner sea is connecting itself, 
begging to be expressed, made sense of,
given light to something beyond the mask we attempt to wear
