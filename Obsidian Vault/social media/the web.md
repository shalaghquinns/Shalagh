the internet has a beautiful power, 
to connect us 
gives us endless possibility to interact with the people of our kin, 
our our truth in a new form. 

Until now our connection to each other has been hindered by race, 
social group, and religon. Until now we have been connecting to people through a shared beleif systems and social structures from the world around us. 

The internet has a power to connect us with people of the same truth, 
of the same inner beleif systems, of the same inner worlds, 
but the power of the beast, requires us to learn to tell a new truth, 
a new story to our brothers and sisters, 
one that is of an inner truth, 
a true truth. 
Not of the one the world around us has projected upon us, 
we are made to break the image this world has projected onto itself, 
because it is hurting our souls,
we are at war, 
fighting our brothers and sisters, about these made up systems, 
about these external games, money, numbers, power, and religion. 

We need to learn to speak of a new truth, 
the one we are really having, 
and we will find those who will support us.
and we need to do it now, because the story we are telling to eachother has gotten out of hand, 

share as your participation to the rebellion
of that which is not working any more, 
share the stupid, share the fun, become embarrassed of your self,
turn the image inside out, 
we have to dramatize it, 
play out our karma. 

**the impossible mountain** 

1 and 2 
Time is the chance we are given 
to play out our karma, 
to take life to its fullest extent. 
Karma is the work we came to do, 
and the work is internal, 
it is a personal process we are meant to enter into willingly, 

here is a story about the impossible mountain 

3 and 4
the impossible mountain is the mountain you create for yourself in life, 
all the stuff that is too challenging to imagine dealing with,

we tuck it away and hide from in in many forms, 

5 and 6
we settle, and build towns at the base of the mountain.

and we chat about the impossible mountain, 
that we want to try and climb, but no one dares to leave the town,

7 and 8
when you decide to take up your karma on earth, 
you take the journey to climb the impossible mountain, 
one step at a time 

8 and 9 
and it becomes possible.
for the impossible mountain was only impossible 
because we imagined it was 

10 and 11 
being on earth is our chance to make what we imagine possible, 
we each have our own impossible mountian we've created for ouself to climb 

12 and 13 
the trick to your impossible mountain 
is becoming more creative at climbing it
than you were at creating it.
