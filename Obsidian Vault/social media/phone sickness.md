The greatest danger of social media is the power it takes from actual reality. The way it strips existence of its imagined potential. Our imagination is our greatest power and we need it more than ever right now. Our imagination will pull us through this mess, but not like how we have imagined it.

The future has let go of the identity that comes from screens. We understand that there is no substance to numbers and likes, and instead we choose participate in the online world because it can free us to go against the ingrained pattern in real life.

Social media changed the social fabric and imaginative experience of our reality by keeping our imagined experience into boxes and in roles. To participate in social media without playing into those roles, helps to free yourself in real life. To practise sharing your world to the ones you love without trying to get their attention, is the antidote to this sickness.

The phone experience is reality showing itself that it is a mirror. What's happening outside is what is happening inside, and vise versa. When we can participate in the outside experience without caring how it looks to others, then our inside can learn also not to care how it looks to others. We must free our inside experience from how it looks to others or else our inner vision, our imagination, can not navigate clearly because it will always look to the external reality to see how its suppose to be done.
