remember the feeling 
when you try and capture a moment 
and somethings missing 
we want to capture the way it felt
the feeling can never be fully captured 

yet we have this urge to capture the moments
to create a feeling 

the price of the moment has gone up
the right moment captured has a worth 
a value, a future, a product,
we can make a living off of capturing moments 

but something deeply unsatisfying grows 
in the eyes of the viewer 
of these perfectly created feelings 
as we feel all these amazing things 
while watching, and leave feeling empty 
devoid of creativity 

in reality 
each moment has multiple realities, 
it is connected to the last moment, the one before, 
it contains many perspectives, 
an interior resonance that is in relationship to the environment,
and so much more depth and juice and life, 
than the mental comprehensive of beautiful imagery 

images can create an amazing feeling 
but the feeling is always in reflection to what we are already going through 
we can never experience a photo or a song the same way again,
the photo and song is only used to create a reflection 
for what our inside was searching for

however when the feeling is only a reflection of the feeling 
and not of the direct experience than we are not having a real feeling 
because the real feeling contains multiple layers, 
an inner depth, a story, a juice, a truth 
something that can never be deduced to an image 

the truth of beauty of this world 
is it does not need to be recreated 
for it can never be separated from time

beauty is only the refection of an inner experience
so the creation of beauty is not necessary 




and ironically the realities that give us this feeling 
that we yearn for, 
this moments of empowerment and beauty, 
the ones who have created these worlds 
we imagine into 

are not living in them 

they are living in the process 
of creating the image of a beautiful reality, 
they are not themselves, 
living in the same beautiful reality
they created
