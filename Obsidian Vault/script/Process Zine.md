the process zine is like a joke
in that i never know where its going on, 
but it always has a punch line to give me, 
a funny way that makes everything it did before 
make sense 

this project as a metaphor for trusting the creative process, 
I wanted to see what was meant to learn from this process and the project 
because the creative stream I would use to practise documenting and following this thing i trusted so deeply in, 
the process, 
and what happened was a deepening, 
each layer would open me into a vaster understanding, 
I began by eliminating any timeline I had on the project, 
then I had to eliminate the need to share the process, 
then it opened into many streams and sides 
I began breaking down the natural process of creation through the stars 
and creating my own language which taught me I had to 
find another way of understanding this experience 
and then I had to loose the need to understand it and wrap my head around it, 
and now I am playing through multiple streams 
different games on different layers of experiences 
in things we call instagram accounts 
and each one signifies a different layer of my conscious experience
