we have been taught and formed 
on the need to think about our world through the frame of numbers 
through money through  time
we want external guarantee and known outcomes. 

We believe time is something happening outside of us, 
something that the more we plan it, 
the more we know it, 
the more we can guarantee a numerical outcome, 
the more we can receive from it. 

what if the gift of time is not something we can know and plan?
what if the gift is in the way it reveals itself to us in a process
through an internal experience with no external prof
what if all the need to prove our value stops us from the greatest value 
and the greatest value we have is not something that can be shared with anyone 
how does that change your experience.

or more worth, to make more value of the time we have
the ways we make sense of our time, 
most every moment in the day, 
comes from an external system 

A lot of the grander problem on earth arise, 
because of our need to make more external evidence of our time.

To always want more and more money trains us to see our time 
as something that we can plan and make the most external value from. 
This little collective game has caused climate change, wars, and all the problems with power. 
Its just happening on a level thats so embedded in the existing systems 
that its hard to spot.

Money, Power, Religon  

The big problem makers of the days 
These 3 horses are all intertwined pulling the same cart forward, 
The perception of time. 

Money, Power and Religion each have a different ways they reinforce the same collective style of time. A style that pulls the senses out from inside themselves to attempt to make their sense of a world from an external position. To get us to participate in a collective dance that drains us of our inward potential and connection. 

money 

We are surrounded in a world where you can have anything you want, 
at your fingertips, delivered to your door, at any time, 
There is just one cost, money. 
Just easy enough to acquire, just hard enough to sustain. 

The cost for this infinite world, is our time, 
We must give over, sacrifice the discovery 
of the unknown, for a plan

We work our whole lives 
to guarantee good grades and a stable job,
to have enough money.
to work for something that requires just enough energy, 
so the rest of life is based around it, 

Since we formed our life around it, 
there is only one direction it can take us, 
and enough money becomes more and more 
and somehow it never seems like enough. 

  it was the unknown trail of open discovery 
  that the soul wants to take, 
It never wanted a guarantee, 
it only wanted to create a stable enough ground 
to see where it could go, 

Money stops the internal journey of time 
from revealing itself, 
We get caught in the need to know how much 
and can't imagine time beyond the layer of numbers 
It makes it hard to appreciate the free things, 
because we appreciate so much the value 
of what money can bring
Every time frame is soaked in the feeling 
of how much money can or can't be made 

**Power** 

Uses the currency of money to get its energy 
Power enforces the idea that through money 
and externalization you can gain something 

Beyond what money can buy, 
you can gain a sort of power in the world, 
power over money, brings control, 
control creates power 
power gives us meaning

We idolize the successful people 
for their ability to make value of their time, and create power, 
The fantasy of power provokes the world 
towards the search for external results, 

This version of time monopolizes on our fear of death, 
Igniting the desire to create a life that is seemingly 
worthy in the eyes of the world, 

The illusion of power, 
Takes the way the time discovers itself 
and gives its power over to worldly critic, 
The search for power stops us 
from recognizing our unique world inside, 
because we have a set goal of the box we want to land in 
Power is a symptom of needing to control our time 

**Religion** 

Takes the perception of death, and turns it into a version of life
Then the version of life, which is really just a perception of death, 
Ends us colliding with the other versions of life, 
In a way that boils down to a battle between perceptions of the unknown, 

Religion takes the unknown element of time, 
And weaves it into a model of behaviour 
to deal with the unknown worlds. 
The beliefs of the unknown collect together into groups 
And forms ways of life based on what we all 
collectively believe happens when we die, 

This is no coincidence, 

Recognition of death, 
has been shaping the reason behind the ways we choose to live forever. 
Death has alway been the silent understanding, the collective shaping, 
the creator of meaning and reason, a quiet whisper, 
one you cant hear but only feel, waiting for you, 

the design to take that feeling, 
and make it a guarantee that following a set of rules, 
you can make sure you will be saved from this life when you leave, 
sounds like a great idea, and our time was taught to be 
to be guided by external systems 
and invariantly taught to fear death, 
from the consequences of not following along in life

This places barriers on our ability to believe into our own personal experience, 
because of being trained to form our lives around 
what can make sense to us.
