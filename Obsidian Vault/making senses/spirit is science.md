science likes to recognize alot of the characteristics about the physical reality, 
turns out the more we notice about how the physical reality work, 
the more we can know how to make it work for us, 
in this quest for more and more knowledge, 
we forgot to look and seek deeper into the question of why? 

not why plants go through photosynthesis, 
and all the deeper and deeper ways 
that this creates and expresses whats going on around us, 
but why does any of this happen, 

to seek this answer 
we must zoom out on all our collected data, 
and notice the foundational evidence is there are patterns 
moving the energy all the time, 
everything in science is existing within a pattern 

we do not know where any of these patterns originate, 
as they cross weave and deeply pull the imagination, 
rules remain, amongst the chaos of the mind 
everything is interconnected 
something always remains unknown
all discoveries lead to deeper and deeper understanding of a pattern
everything as a layer within a pattern
through this deduction 

we can say that there is an unknown energy 
working through this world all the time 
through the experience of pattern 
manifesting in many layers all at once 

This description encompasses all lessons we can learn
learn about our world, 
and teaches us that the world is 
happening inside ourself 

we are the layers of self
making sense of our self 

the self is not an identity, 
it is an experience
