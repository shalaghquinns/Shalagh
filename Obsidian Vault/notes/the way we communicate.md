always changes 
we are always expanding on our ability to communicate
we have compressed that ability 
in this time and space, 
as we have simaltainously exanding on our capability 
to communiate, we have lost parts of our nature, 
and are having to regain them 
we are having to rember that communicate 
is not depenading on numbers 
because what we have done 
is created the sellable characters to eachother,
