i have always been interested in piegons 
and it come because of a fear of them, 
I was terrifled of them in university because they 
were all over the city
they would come out of no where, 
and they were huddled, togther, 
and their reallly the only animal that has domesticated thmselves in a city 
there these wld animals and they found a way t take advantage of humans 
and i feel that sort of a part of me that I have been scared of but I feel 
inisde like im a freakin piegon, 
I feel like this crazy wid animal, 
thats been placed in this modern world, 
and trapped inside this city 
and im just sort of like colecting the scraps of it 
as I go along, blindly through the city 
like the piegons
and thats what this account is, 
is about that experince 
that I am a sleepy peigon in this world 
a dream I am collecting and making up from inside of me, 
as i go along in this sort of city 

as I take these images, and collect these sort of scaps from the world 
they become how I fly, 
how I image into the reality more, 
and theyve help me connect to this world in a more symbolic way
and I feel like the more I go into the memory, 
the more this world speaks these languages to me through these symbols 
and then all this meaning begins to speak to me 
rather than me trying to find it 
the world begins to become this cnversation, 
where what i feel inside sometimes hapens outside of me 
and i just take a picture intuitively, 
and then I share it 
and then when I recall my memory, 
and I scroll throuh the time creation 
is I dont attcah my memory to the image of who I am 
and instead I attch my memory to this experince that Im having 
and I find a way to give it credit, 
and at the smae time 
I practise embarressng myself 
infornt of the people who I love 
who really are learning 
will not understand you, 
they are iving in there own experince to 
and as much as we share this world and talk about the world that were sharing 
the real world world that were shring 
is the one that we are all going through unknowningly inside of us all day long 
the part of us that is always having to make sense of things 
and has always been stuck in the same moment continuing to just 
make more and mre sense of its world, 
and were always internal, 
and were sharing this world to each like were all going through the same thing 
and then we try all go though the same thing 
and we get programmed into this time of how its suppose to look 
and what the time means 
and we think share the same value of time, 
because money, 
but time doesnt have a value like that 
and we cant put our value into time like we know where its going 
so when you check out your world in a different lens, 
one where youre not trying to create a memory, 
youre also not trying to create a projection of the future 
and instead you move deeper into your future, 
deeper into your past, 
and deeper into your future 

the atlantian system 
is a different understand of time 
it takes the tradutional zodic, 
but its seeing it from the inside, 
so the traditoonal zodiac sees time from the outside version of it 
so all the outter manifestations of the signs 
so everything that it seems like, 
but the atlantain zodiac takes the qualities from the inside of th sign 
and so its a different order 
what this says is time is not happening in a linear way, and instead happening in a spiral

heart break happens when time gets trappen in the heart, 
the heart doest break, it just stiffens, 
and thats so painful for the whole body, 
so to cure heart break is to let go of time 
to unstiffen the heart from the past 
weve got a hard on for the past, 

the mirror with the struggle in the middle east, 
mirrors our strige inside, 
that we can deal with different beleif systems 

the art of notcing 
how it pulls you deeper into your world

the space you create around you,
and how its imporant to be a reflection of your inside world 

the challenge with being an artist is not the art itself 
or anything to do with that, 
its the idea that you are creating time for yourself, 
and you have to make your own value of time 
this is why its such a challening career is becaue if your not being told what to do 
in the day, were so used to be told what to do in the day, and that helps us to focus, 
but to be an artist is rebelling against that where were not being told what to do, 
and you have to choose what to do in your day, 
and that is so hard because you realize you cant cheat time, 
you cant cheat creativity, 
creativity will come to you when your ready, 
all you can do is find the space to make it happen
you cant just work for 8 hours in a day, you have to diversity, 
you have to follow your intuition, 
you have to learn to work for something bigger than yourself, 
and thats the only way it works 
snd so its just a metaphor for the way that were actually meant to work, 
were all artist 
were all creating our reality, were all living in a dream here 

the difference with the future, 
is it lies within us, 
its not something we have find or design it outside, 
its something that each one of us has tot take responsibility for 
as the future of the earth, we have to take responsibility for being the earth, 
for being a planet, 
we have to take responsibilty for that that means 
this externa tragety is just a mirror for our own internal tragety 
we have to come to terms with our own internal power 
and thats the power of the inside experience 

everything i've shared 
has been just the refection of the inward experience 
i'm going though, 
and I wanted to bring you as myself along in it, 
you as in my outer world, 
as in my outer experience 
as in the outer reflection , 
which is all the outer world is, 
is just a reflection of everything happening inside of you 
but I feel like weve been so focused on sharing an external orld 
an external reflection of it
because I ried it out, 
I tied out the external reflection of everything, 
and it brought me so far out into this fake experience 
and I was living in the story of it 
when I began to follow an inward process, 
a whole other journey unfolded, 
my inward world, began to come outside of me with so much strength 

I have a story I want to share 
but its not because I wanna share what was happening outside of me 
its because I want to share what was happenig inside of me, 
so the only thing ive been doing is following an inward porcess, 
ts been so embeddded me ever since ive been born, 
that I wasnt able to fully reconize it 
until this time and this age 
and reconzieng the rpocess I had to go through, 
to go through t, 
and then get out of it, 
so the story i want to share isnot about the story 
it about the nward experince, 
but what im gonng share is the outward experience 
because its just a mirror for what was going on inside 
this process just kept deepening 
it kept unfolding from within itself, 
it kept leading me exactly where I needed to go 
when I stopped trying to find the outward definition of it, 
when I turn it from insie of me
everything is about the time 
everything is about the way we see and use it as a currency, 
our currency of attention, 


time is so outwrd, 
were always trying to grab each others outward attention of it 
the outward attention 
for the image of life, 
the story we've created is taking away from the life
