the signs represent how we experience the pattern 
from a horizontal view, 
as we move our head in a 360 circle, 
we can see the various types of experiences
of layers of worlds that are happening around us, 
we can notice how our continuous changes based on 
what world we are located in 
(space)

the houses represent how we experience the pattern 
from a vertical view, 
as we tilt our head, 
we see the sun traveling through the sky, 
we can notice how my experience and the 
experience of whats around me 
changes based on where the sun is in the sky. 
(time)

when we look at someones chart 
we are looking at both the time 
and space that they came from. 

the space is where in space,
the planets were at the time of birth, 
the space will tell us how part of us is behaving 
the space is the feeling of what surrounds us, 
so the space will show us how parts of us feel, 
we where certain outfits, and act as different characters 
based on the space we are in 
the space will show us how we behave and act 

the time is where in time, 
the planets were at the time of your birth, 
much of our day is governed by our perception 
of the time of day, 
the time determines how our conciseness behaves, 
whether it is acting subconsciously as it sleeps, 
or consciously as its awake, 
where in our conscious awareness are we acting from 
is determined by the time 
Time determines our rhythm of the day,
time determines how we spend the energy that we have 
these are all the things the "houses" show us.
