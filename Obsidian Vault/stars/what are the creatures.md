the creatures are a language of symbolize 
to describe the pattern of the zodiac

the pattern of the zodiac is often understood 
through the signs as as descriptions of characters, 
and through the external experience and characteristics of each sign 
We talk about the qualities of the Zodiac as the exists on the outside, 
the pattern that the creatures symbolize is the internal experience, 
and inner process of the signs. 

The books provoke us to use our imagination, 
to imagination how the internal experience 
would create a physical reality. 

By keying into each stage of the 
creative process step by step
that is unfolding within our experience, 
the creatures are designed to go inside 


I will use this space
to go into each world within the pattern 
and teach how to use these planets 
in reflection to our time of birth
