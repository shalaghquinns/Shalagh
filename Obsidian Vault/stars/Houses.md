first 
we are brought into the centre of our most essential self where a core power remains as the world current fluctuates around. The senses and perception delicately stream the world through and creates a seemless relationship to the moment. The hope is to meet each moment a new so as not be caught in a previously experienced story. The power of the first house is in its openness and powerful centre that is alway open to give and receive new experiences. Everything is always changing, but whats essential stays. Through staying tuned in we become a vessel to sift through chaos and cling to what is true. We learn not overly consume our vitality and become in-tune with its constantly feeding rythmn. When we are really here we are accompanied by a pulse that will drift us naturally into each passing moment. 


**first**- 

We remain deep inside the place we have always known. 

This knowing is protected as we go through many changes, what's most essential stays. 

A simple and fresh perspective insists itself necessary to preserve core values. 

We shield and protect our instincts. 

The external world doesn't always respect this form of growth, and we are forces into the waves of our experience, through friction to build up the strength of this inner knowing. we are learning to let ourselves be as we move through this testing ground, becoming more open to contradicting  experiences and simultaneously more aware of our own internal processes and discoveries. 

As we become more aware of who we are a memory of the past opens into the future, and an internal pace finds its beat and ability continue to love from the center and open to fresh streams of insight. The differences we experience eventually become a part of what we have always known.  

  

**second -** 

we come into a world that makes sense, it forms itself around us and from us. 

We are called to remember further and stay on the beam of our inner knowing which will be tested and test again as we meet the external world. 

We are staying within a journey, and must give it over again and again to continue participating in it. The prof of our inner knowing is changing, the hints are stronger, but more subtle. 

We are being shown we are a part of something bigger and than we could have imagined  

this world supports us even when we cant grasp it and form it. 

We are sinking beyond knowing into the doors of all of existence. 

In this vastness we experience an inner knowing that our experience here is valid and needed. 

We are here not just as a reflection of our world, but deeply intertwined into the fabric of time. 

When we can grasp we are needed the house strip us of our inflated ego and grandiose mind that attempted to define our specific role. 

We are outfitted from our assumptions and left with out greatest treasure. 

It feels as though all of existence  waits for us to decide if we will become more than we think. 

We think there is a way we can think up doing this, but in the mean time we are called to break free from our shell. 

  

**third**

there becomes a gap between a deep inner experience and outer world grasping conciseness. We are attempting at each moment to make sense of the moment, and our part in it. We love to define our peers and form it into and understanding of appropriate response, which is then processed on a separate level. Over time there becomes a need to bridge the gap, which is the is process of becoming a living vessel to the currents. We must tap the tune of the earth, and listen through ourselves to come to meet each moment freely. An aliveness is ignited in the creation of the bridge, which is sustained as the soul learns to escape the need to design and construct within past structures, and becomes the surge of the moments pulsating future. 

We meet life on the surface, playing into all the sides and games. 

Nothing feels real until we feel into the gap that is missing, an edge of darkness we forgot to deal with.

An inside voice becomes more powerful than the need to fit into the crowd. Our mass identification with the external world fades its importance, and we are tipped into an alternative style of existence. 

We can no longer keep things light and easy, the part of us that we meet when we are alone, the deep inner calling, is asking to come forward into the world. 

We are asked to move from the surface distractions, and change our direction. All the need for this change comes through the body becoming more online and Intune with an internal rather than an external current. 

We must shift from doing things for our individual ego to recognize that everything happening here is for the benefit of everyone, and that all we are pushed todo it unite our being into something that works for all, which will in turn work for ourselves. 

  

forth house 

**story of the forth house.** 

where ever we were not meant in childhood and in early experiences, we had to tuck away. On the surface we became our family, on the inside a part of us was forgotten. 

we seem lost, and can sense there is a part of ourselves we forgot. We must wait a long time in this space before it can understand what its doing. 

A part of ourselves, a dream, something we have never seen before, seeks to become an active part of who we are. 

We cannot play into the masks or personality standards, because something in our body feels much more important. 

We try and escape this place. It doesn't make sense because its senses have yet to be made. We must create room for this instinct to become a part of the person we are embodying. We have to create something to give this place a credit. 

Our instincts will travel deep, we must meet the depth to make it make sense, to learn to take seriously a feeling inside. One that has no previously determined external value. 

When we travel to the depths we are granted a freedom to become our full self, free of all predetermined personality states, into the land which we can discover our destiny. 

  

**5th house story** 

We come out from the depths to play into our bodies potential, 

we are activated by destiny, and constantly come up against ourselves when we feel we are not living up to our full potential 

We track closely with what is inspiring us, and create routines and patterns to keep us doing our best 

We are celebrated externally and this keeps us doing our best, we never turn off the act.

at some point we do not live up to the image we created externally and the refection fails no matter how hard we try, something doesn't turn out the way it seemed outside

we turn the reflection inside and are met with all the ghosts of our past, all the places we hid from and denied. 

We turn attention inwards to understand what moved us into this external dance. We learn to see where our senses came from and in the process begin to make less sense to others and more sense to ourselves, and loosing the need to make sense to everyone else. Our external validation fuel has run out. 

Once we are no longer directed by how we appear externally, no surface appearance is needed because we are filled with a spirit presence. We give ourselves infinite creative space, and we embody a truth that gives others permission to be their true and full self. 


**6th house story**  
  
We are working doing the daily unconscious tasks as a routine, on the outside we are practising addressing all the multiple layers of life and the things that ought to be done to take care of it. On the inside we are taking this multi dimensionality to the next level, where we are working towards a future where embracing the many layers of things exists for all. We seek to make available many layer of experience for everyone.   
We remain straight forward and clear in our external approach so as not to disrupt or imprint the multiple layers we are observing.   
We have lost our singular identity and replaced it with a flexibility to deal with everything  
and Inner process is searching all the time for a wide open future for all, while the outside maintains a formal customary appearance   
  
Our inner network is strong and we are stimulated by heating up new internal pathways to keep it growing, bridging and cross pollinating internally.   
This house is a bridge between our  deep truth and bringing it out into the world where we can be it fully. In the sixth house we carve out the room inside to understand how we can exist fully, so we can design a world that opens for all, including ourselves, as the world.   
  
As the inner and outer worlds converge the sixth house is slowly emerging into reality, as the world becomes a space to digest multiple realities, rather than just a formal appearance.   
  
  
**7th house story** - tuning   
  
we have lost the grip on our self and this body is surrendered into the open world  
we are stimulated by the unknown, meeting ourselves as the reflection  
the dance and constant discovery keeps us constantly engaged and the current alive   
the relationship are no coincident, they are internally thematic, and we know how to show up in relationship to heighten the experience for all   
  
the more we explore outside the more we must open on yourself .   
there is an uncovering, a deepening, and our instincts pull us out to constantly to showup   
The only stability we face is that the world will meet us as we grow into it  
  
slowly the relationships strip us from the act, we can not get away from a deepening and using the other to hide from ourselves.  
This house seeks full expression of all its planets, and they infused with a willingness to engage  
  
As we give out our energy we are taught to be as present to ourselves as we are to others  
not to give away our energy, not to be so drawn outside by the thrill of the other, and instead to come back to our familiar home inside.   
We are learning to tune our inner world to the outer one, not the other way around.   
  
**8th house story** - merging   
  
we enter into the world we remember, picking up on the drama and magnetism of our patterns and playing into a knowing of how it feels it should be.   
We know how to behave and do the earthly dance, but we don't know what we don't want to know, and on the outer we act as though we don't want to know.   
We must reckon with our limitations and everything that has held us back to enter into open space, and learn not to turn around when things get strange and uncertain.  
  
We enter the path of becoming, but it is only a enactment of how it seems and should be done, for to actually become we must become who we are not.   
We are picking up on the familiar world, the one that makes sense already.  
To enter into our depths we must take up the difficult path, the one we did not want go, the part we hoped we could get away without.   
When we go here we can see we are supported by the darkness and can wilfully enter into the free flow we were seeking and acting out.   
  
If we can go here we can see what's truly holding back humanity, and can sniff through all false appearances. We are being guided by spirit to stay on track, and not fall for the moments drama any more.   
  
We are linking up with one another to create a bond that moves beyond the self and own our identity, to discover who we can be and who we cannot be any longer. We must merge with one another, give ourselves over and become inside where the world is taking us, this merging and surrender links us to a greater destiny, empowers us and moves us forward. We are designed to unite.   
  
Our body becomes charged with the dare, the vision, and the memory of the place we dreamed of going.   
  
**9th house Story** - witness   
  
A core self is enacted whether anyone else is watching, it plays into all the worlds its ever been as the main actor. The surface performer plays along with all the externally drama so that the internal witness gathers the reacts and external as evidence to the truth we know exists inside.   
We are only playing along collecting evidence of our greatness, and feel inside to be above all of this. Although we have gathered admiration and external validation externally, the inner witness is unimpressed with this drama and wants a deeper truth to be revealed. The witness inside can see all parts of life as equal and part of the process, and wants us to move through them without taste or hierarchy.  
  
Everything is material for our own becoming, so we can end up feeling alone and fixated on our own creation. In this discovery  we become all sides, what we dread, hoped for, and assumed would happened.   
  
The next stage takes up beyond telling ourselves about who we are, why were here and who we might be, into becoming cosmically charged. Instead of becoming something special, we instead ask what is needed from us in the world. We can then bear an impartial witness with a renewed and wild self acceptance.   
  
**10th house story-** truth   
  
We cross over into a place that is beyond the current time frame and into a power that brings the future into the now. We being by being trapped in a space with no direction out, except in. It takes a complete renouncing of where we thought we were going and where we wanted to be. For we carry a heavy karmic pattern of all the jobs we took on in place of our destiny.   
  
We are coming from a closed tight system, into the free arena. We've come on our journey, and must not be impressed with ourselves and how others see us. The point is to remain spacious, dispassionate and focused, for we have a destiny to get on with. To do this we must learn to encompass and welcome in the dark and not move to quickly towards the light.   
  
We can not attempt to control or be on top of, or make sense of the direction we are being pulled, and ignore the external appearance of how it seems.   
  
Here the spirit is given a voice.   
We must allow our sensibility for truth to permeate, to sense our integrity and to deeply respect ourselves and our voice.   
We can attune to the frequency of truth that lives within and become a resource spring for others to tap   
  
**11th house story**- selfless   
  
We are granted a vision that opens all sides of life and an understanding that knows what to do with them. Our instinct is to evolve and we are supported as we meet the world with a sense of freedom. We link up with others on our journey, rather than settle into a routine.   
  
Our direction has no prior context and ability to articulate. We cannot locate an identity, only giving ourselves the permission to be the light and to keep expanding. We can sense the urgency of time, and it pushed us to keep on expanding. We are restless with our potential to awaken future worlds.   
  
We dwell in an open space for quite some time before understanding how to bring it down to earth. In this space we feel a specialness for having come so far, but as we dwell here and begin to being it down to earth, we can see that what we have to offer is much simpler and grounded than what was previously imagined or projected onto us.  
  
When time time comes for the future to open it will be when the earth is ready to experience what we had already been waiting with, and the idea doesn't seem so far out after all.   
We encounter a selfless being that can awaken a shared sphere for all he encounters   
  
**12 house story:**   
  
We are in the dark, brought through the unknown, and taught our to feel our way though. We are asked to stay present in the darkness that consumes us and not to get distracted by external surface considerations. Sensing beyond logal and what can be seen and grasped in the place w
