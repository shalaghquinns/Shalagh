imagine a world without this screen... 

in this world, 
anything you want to create 
you must find it in reality, 
you must engage in the steps forward 
to put what you imagination into action, 
we must work into the vision of 
what we want to see happen 
we have to make sense of the problem, 
to make sense from non sense 

we have to create how we sense, 
to give life to the unknown, 
and along the way, 
the conversation between our senses
stitches together the known and unknown, 
and the process becomes a dance, 
of revealing itself. 

we feel at home here 
on earth 
in this dance, 
we feel supported, 
we feel connected, 
we feel a part of the experience, 

**art is creating our** 
**own sense of the world,** 

it doesn't matter what it is
it doesn't matter what it looks like

its in the process of creating it,
we are making up our senses, 
we are forging a path, 
based on our internal freedom 
about how we want to envision this life 

by putting the vision into action, 
we become active participants 
in the sensory experience of the world 

we come to touch our experience 
from the inside out

the intuitive experience stems from 
looking at how your internal world responds to its environment 
rather than how you are responding to your external world 

we have so much beautiful art out there
and amazing creations 
everything our senses crave to create 
can met by the screen 

but this does not satisfy our creative expression
and instead blocks us from being creativity engaged with the world 
because the screen world appears more interesting 


we need to stop staying stuff on here 
designed to help other make sense of an external reality, 

we want to make so much sense to someone 
that they make new sense of them self  
so we try very hard to make sense to others 
and forget we are the only ones making sense of this place anyways 






we are infinity 
tied into tiny human bodies, 
here to comprehend karma, 
so that the sun can have energy to shine
