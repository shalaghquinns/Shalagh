in university i was addicted to adhd pills 
all my energy went into fulfilling the world outside of me, 
when I found yoga I learned how to fulfill my inner world 
I fell in love with the internal process of that was unfolding inside me 
I became obsessed with astrology for it was the only thing I could find that gave credit to this internal process 

I studied it for years but could never understand where it came from 
or why any of these charastictics came from 
everything felt diluted and dumbed down into basic personality traits 
then I discovered these 2 books 
one went into each degree in the 360 degree pattern 
the other went into each planet in all the signs and houses 
they did not talk about the way astrology existed on the outside,
and instead focused on the inward experience

I spent the next 2 years translating these books 
as a way to understand the system from the inside out

I translated each degree into a sentance, 
and each planet into a paragraph of its experince in the signs and houses, 

then I contacted the author of the books to share what I had done, 
he was drawn to the work and we have been talking every week for the last 3 years, 

Ellias has taught me not only how to understand the language of the stars, 
but how to live through them. I feel it is my responsibility to share this work to the world.
