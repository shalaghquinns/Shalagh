it began with religion, 
Organized religion turned our life in to the stage to work for something we receive when we leave this planet. The value of our experience was given over to god. Rules and formulas began to structure our behaviour on large scale. The church created a set of rules under the name of god, for us to behave. Our sense of self and who we were, came from our relationship to god - from a reference that has been defined for us. This taught the collective to rely on an external definition to create a sense of self. Religion had us working for the unknown. 

Then came money 
The Copernicus revolution flipped the switch for society to move towards a more known direction and led us to find questions and answers about unknown territory. Science created many advancements and the industrial revolution fuelled the collective in a new direction. We were being given the opportunity to create anything unknown, and make it known, we were on the track to bring dreams to life. The known dream came in the form of money. With more advancements came more jobs, and more ways to exchange money. The growth of the known world continued, until we had invented a world with infinite options of what to do here with our time, but it was all at one cost, money. Money taught us to rely on numbers

Then came identity
Once our trust in the validity and trust in numbers had been widen established. A dream appeared on earth that allowed people to make numbers just by being themselves. They only had to get enough numbers online, enough social approval, they only had to create a time with enough value for enough people to enjoy it. So the era of social media changes the way we see ourself in relationship to time. Can we extract the most amount of value from the situation? even if we are not sharing on social media, we still use our phone cameras as if we are trying to take the most from the moment. Because there is a currency for it, we mimic this experience. This game plays through us. We begin to see our external world, as a reflection of our identity. We develop a sense of self through the things we have around. The effects of social media is imbued into the time, no one is immune, except maybe those who are not on their phones....

These are the ways that the external systems of earth have taken our time out from inside, and taught us to give it away. This program runs deep in our veins, it fuels this race of time. It is up to us to question 


dealing the the problem head on 
we cannot escape our phones, 
they have become a part of us, 
they are a disease, because the content we share is toxic, 
but its not the phones that are toxic, 
it us, 
its the way we use them
the way we are all trying to steal each others attention
to create a worthy perception, 
to put moments on a pedestal, 

the problem is 
we are using the app for what these systems of control
designed it from
we are not using it to create the real world we want to be in. 

this is the revolution we are facing, 
we are uprooting the systems, 
we are a collective in need of a change 
a change that is coming through each person, 
the choice to change is up to us, 
to each take responsibility 
for the death of our identity

these systems that have pulled us apart from each other, 
that have put us in comparison,
within the formula of an algorithm 
that is in control after we put the phone down  

I love getting no likes,


the monetization of death, 
the collective infusion with the idea 
that we have a certain amount time here on earth, 
that what we do with our time is important 
because it effects what happens later 

when we lost the collective grip on religion
through the Copernicus revolution 
due to consequences of globalization, 
a mixing of cultures, and the rise of science
what remained was the belief in the colective unconscious 
that we had to a certain amount of time value, 
as we developed more ways to exchange our time for money, 
the popularity of clocks became associated with a numerical worth, 
our time began to be perceived as something we could gain more of if we created with it more efficiently, 
the industrial revolution onwards our society greatly accelerated its ability to do and achieve more value with its time. Never once stopping to ask, 
what is the true value of time.
