we use time 
to define time,
an idea we created 
has now created itself into us

everything we do 
is in reference to time 
our conscious experience is in a calculative dance 
with the time thats moving around us

we want to do the most with it, 
we want to make some prof of it, 
we want cash in our hands to know 
our time has value 

and the numbers give us the prof of the value of the time, 
they give us meaning, they give us food on our table. 
through numbers we survive 
so it makes sense that we give them a lot of credit 

but in many cases, 
we give the numbers priority 
over another voice 
choosing the known 
over the unknown 
sacrificing a part of ourself 
that we might know 
or might never know 

*time is running* 
*inside* 
*not on a line*
