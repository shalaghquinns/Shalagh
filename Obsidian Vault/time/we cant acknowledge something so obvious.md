we will go insane 
before we let it make sense 

it would collapse the 
mental frame work of everything 


all this mental frame work 
is supporting an idea, 
and all it takes is for that idea
to mean something completely different  
for all the frame work to collapse


time is an invention
that creates the experience 
that this world is happening 
outside of ourself 


time provokes our perception 
to seek for numerical validation 
to make sense of itself 


time gives a frame 
that we use as a known reference point


time appears as a number, 
so we want to add it up and make sense 


time helps us keep track so that we can know 
whats going on,


time creates the experience 
that we know whats going on.




*every time had a frame,* 
*and all the clocks were hung on walls,* 
*but time wasn't watching you keeping track* 
*but time was on the floor* 


**The sacrifice of knowing the time** 

we use time 
to define time,
an idea we created 
has now created itself into us

everything we do 
is in reference to time 
our conscious experience is in a calculative dance 
with the time thats moving around us

we want to do the most with it, 
we want to make some prof of it, 
we want cash in our hands to know 
our time has value 

and the numbers give us the prof of the value of the time, 
they give us meaning, they give us food on our table. 
through numbers we survive 
so it makes sense that we give them a lot of credit 

but in many cases, 
we give the numbers priority 
over another voice 
choosing the known 
over the unknown 
on some level sacrificing 
a part of ourself 
that we might know 
or might never know 



*time is running* 
*inside* 
*not on a line* 

everything was always deepening, 
since you got here all you've been doing, 
is making more and more sense of your world 

each moment adds on each other, 
as you go deeper as deeper inside
but thats not how we make it seem

the story we tell about our world is much more linear,

**films:** 
**the reflection of our world,** 
**our reflection of time**


films are always a reflection of the time they came from, 
when they are released films mirror current issues in the world, 
certain themes, characters and story lines that are relevant of the time, 
the quality of video and special effects also mirrors the time period 
the film was created and released, 

the films we watch mimic the world we are in, 
the screen is a reflection of the world we exist in, 
so we turn to the screen on how to see how existence behaves 
and then reference these behaviours as a standard in real life, 
ie if someone on television does it, 
I can too.

we watch so many movies and films, 
that we believe life operates in a similar way, 
that things are suppose to happen on a linear time line, 

as we watch the screen, 
and then watch our world, 
hoping to be fed it in a way that makes sense, 
just like the movies, 
and then forgot, 
that we're the ones who have to 
make our own sense of this place. 

**our imagination got lazy** 

anything we could ever imagine 
we have access to in seconds 
...



numbers gave the meaning feeling 
but the meaning ain't real 
so the feeling ain't either 



*this is a world without lines,* 
*not one thing is defined,* 


**what money did to time**

in a world where everything was just a 
reflection of everything else
everything had become separated 
with a definition 
anyways that wasn't the point, 
what mattered is we created systems from this seperation, 
that divided up an experience that was never divided

its just very unnatural 
and the repercussions 
have created a situation that 
makes no sense 

their are so many numbers involved, 
facts, articles, information and sides to consider 
about the ways money had divided up the world
and created so many problems impossible to conceive 
the only conclusion we can draw is that 
all this money 
came from our perception of time 

how can you make 
your time 
your money 

thats the game on earth. 
thats how we got here

money and time 
are in an open relationship 
constantly feeding off each other 
to maintain the experience 
that this external reality
that is providing for us

as money gives us our survival needs, 
we give it our time. 
but the exchange isn't fair, 
this is the great inequality 

some people get shit all for their time, 
and some people are paid hella,
this is motivates us, 
this moves us, 
we want to make the most from our time

we go to great lengths 
to celebrate and maintain the image,
that we get the most from our time, 
we work to prove to ourself and others 
that we knew what we were doing 

but time had no idea what it was doing
thats not why it was moving
time was just creating itself further into itself 



time had reached 
a point in time 
that it had created 
everything time could 
have ever imagined 
and now it was time 
to imagine a time 
without itself 


the greatest gift on earth 
time 

once we are unable to find solace in the external world 
we have no where to turn but inside
this world is loosing its ability to be made sense of



















use it up, so we are using u our experience on earth, 



unfortunately 
no more external issues can be addressed, 
everything we need to change 
is being born from within 
each of us.






this is all none sense, 
added up with a bunch of numbers, 
but its still all nonsense, 
and its not your responsibility to make sense of it

your responsibility 
is your response ability, and this does not include all the problems of the world, 
but it does put a-lot of attention into your inner experience and implication 
that you are the only 







but none of it was actually what we valued 
it was just the definations we used to value stuff, 
but we had become more drawn to the defintion of value 
than the sense that it created internally.
