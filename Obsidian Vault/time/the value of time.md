Time is art 


and like art, 

its value goes up with time, 


The further we get away from the origin of creation, 
The more deeply we value its existence 
When we create with time, 
allowing it to take us over, 
The value of our time deepens, 
Seconds become more meaningful, 
And the essence of the day is imbued, 
with the building an inner kingdom, 
Let the frequency dig deeper, 
The waves of experience craved further into the walls,
We let creation through us 
We let it take over, 
We become the thread, 
Conciseness rides its way through the reflections 
And threaded through so that the time 
Unfolds, it grows and stacks in circles,
And cycles, patterns, meaning and senses 
Are engaged and tapped into an activate 
Process 
Time is art
