creativity
- we must not only create our worlds but the systems within them. Create systems around how you create. 
- creativity is nothing but the refection it gives us. 
- the reflection has become refracted to find external validation 
- when we relate our creative experience  to numbers, we place a lens on the creativity that blocks the flow. 
- we attempt t rationalize and know this world, thus preventing the possibility to flow through. 
- creativity doesn't want a place to go, or an identity, it wants to be, to be scene, to become something, so that it can act out and make sense of whats craving a voice inside. 
- we must make sense of nonsense, 
- we are always making sense of our world
