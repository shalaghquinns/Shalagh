**Synopsis:** 

There are many course available to teach many sides of life. We engage in learning so that we make more and more sense of our experience. This is a corse designed to teach you how to make sense of your world from the inside out, instead of looking to the world the outside to create your world. 

We will explore our reliance on the external world to make sense to us and the way our perception of external time provokes us to make sense based on external systems.

We will use the lens of astrology to understand how we can make sense of the experince inside. Through breaking down the solar system and planets we will begin to see this practise as a multi layered pattern that is unfolding within us. We will see how the planets are experiences and systems of time that when brought into our awareness can become internal structures that allow us to lean on and give credit to the internal experience. 

We will explore various creative activities that provoke us to make sense of our inner experience. We will touch on the modern expectations of creativity and how they go against the internal creative nature of things. The effects of social media, films, and scrolling on our imagination and ability to relate to our environment. 

In these times it is becoming harder and harder to rely on and make sense of the external world. As the systems and structures that create our world begin to fail its important that we turn to our own experience to learn to make sense of our world.
