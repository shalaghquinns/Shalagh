the future surge in the death realms at the turning point in time
dear inner family,
the primacy of spirit connection is coming on alive amongst the living as a felt need, a desperate hunger in this changing crucial time. But people have burned their bridges to the wolds beyond, they have taught themselves not to go there for fear of deluding the self with idol fantasies, best to stay where we are and deal with what is right. So of us cast off our physical form among the dead, then we look back out there to the world of the living, the once born, and we here the cry, feel the need, get inside of the critical nature of what each one among the living is send out on subconscious frequency saying is there anybody here to help, is there any body I can believe in.">

the future surge in the death realms at the turning point in time</p>
<p>dear inner family,
the primacy of spirit connection is coming on alive amongst the living as a felt need, a desperate hunger in this changing crucial time. But people have burned their bridges to the wolds beyond, they have taught themselves not to go there for fear of deluding the self with idol fantasies, best to stay where we are and deal with what is right. So of us cast off our physical form among the dead, then we look back out there to the world of the living, the once born, and we here the cry, feel the need, get inside of the critical nature of what each one among the living is send out on subconscious frequency saying is there anybody here to help, is there any body I can believe in.</p>
<p>They have to be like me because spirit being any cosmic entities are alien and I won&rsquo;t let them get me. When we die now, in recent years, we who you imagine to be dead, are faced with a roar of hunger and this among our brothers and sisters who live onward, and we can&rsquo;t any longer refuse the outer mind pull back against the dead, which now seems a trivial and small matter to cut through. We dive under it and find a soul that is open to us, linked with us so closely, and so we do respond, we mobilize our forces to be in a whole new kind of communion with those we love among the living and we awakening dead can love any and all called to us, who ask who seek.</p>
<p>The very greatest changes are a far more intensive commitment to be here for the living as the earth cracks open and death is everywhere in the air. The spirit charged death wakeners, can also see forward in time. Man is only going to get smarter and sharper and more urgent and fervent. Those who live in this cracking earth on the outside, are subjected to a very pressurized vibrational frequency, that they need help with. The awakening dead know how to come in  there and gave the crucial mediation to make the different.</p>
<p>Here is what we do, our impulse throughout is to accompany a living soul in their ascension, offering them which ever level of support and encouragement they need for the living spirit. For we are empowered our selves to get very deep inside the soul and love in effective ways that wont be blocked. We are especially adept in tracking very sharply the vital need, the most pivotal place where energies and awareness can shift the balance from bare survival to being able to evolve with the times meaningfully.</p>
<p>Our utmost desire is to neutralize and in many cases counter the influences of false and distorted outer energies that are driving people crazy. We do a subtle dance assisting the deeper mind in seeing through the lies and distortions of what imprints itself endlessly in surface mind as worry, anxiety, stress, and we can have access range to even our substantive weight of basic assistance. We understand such situations implicitly and have o quarrel with them , our path with the living is to go where we can make a difference and we stay on the beam in a lawful pattern guided by the angels and higher spirit beings.</p>
<p>I will admit that it is impossible for the dead to keep up with the current demand for our services, we are training people day and night and still the accelerating cry is more than we can meet at optimal levels. Currently we drawn drawn to the place where either it must be responded, or we are working closely with a few to bring them along very far to a point where they can help just as much. For it is the awakening living who will make just as big a difference as we ever can. Out greatest challenge ow is to stay centered and focused within our own spirit alignment, when the fall comes into us from so many sides and we feel all the ways we cant do enough.</p>
<p>Fortunately the awakened death are not caught up in duty or marderdom syndromes nonetheless we feel everything with an open soul and we cannot help  being a little breathless on there time. Besides these broader occurrences I am invoking there are also more specialized realms in a heightened urgency now. All of these foster around the destiny impulse to bring a forwarding wind to humanity and evolution, by catalyzing radical change in a few souls and in a few domains of life. When it comes to these very particular streams it is a matter of working timelessly, with those who have done all this forever and who now collaborate intensively with us toward the future that is meant to be.</p>
<p>Deep core work with key living souls is keyed now to being able to bridge across the threshold when this is blocked in a certain way and needs lots of collaborative activity to get unblocked. This is a mystery that we must now reveal, get to the center of and find our way through. While it is possible for many among the dead now to fulfill mercy missions in relation to the living, the more profound communication between the worlds has yet to open up sufficiently simple because there is a barrier erected to keep us apart.</p>
<p>What we can send across is just enough energy and awareness to keep many going a little longer, keep them feeling a little better, keep them open to what is meant to be and to be free of the despair zone. What we cannot bear as yet is the essence of who we are as something which transmutes the very basis of earth exsistnace of the dense ability to restore themselves to their original and ultimate truth after dying. Yet I am part of a pilot project, intended to do just this. Here is what I have uncovered in over 6 years of work at this most pioneers edge of the work between those who were born once and those who are born again of the spirit after dying. It has proven relitivly easy for me to overcome the massive collective barrier before it is ready to break open soon, on a larger scale. I am in a pilot project of serching out ahead of finding what are the consequences of if the dead really can get through all the way. My best efforts have gone into sustaing true image an auentic grasp of what is real, what is essential, what is furthering. So far I have not been able to change any karmic patterns, alter any destiny directions, shift any core momentums, with the excepting of one of these, the only part I put my whole being behind, I committed myself after dying to Ellias Merlin, my star mate across the threshold to enter upon his rightful path of receiving and giving love, so that he could raise into every interpersonal encounter. Even this intervention turned out to be very hard to pull off, there were many other forces a work and some of the darker ones were determined to stop this initiative cold. Yet we did pull through barely. Now Ellias is fulfilling his destiny path with no further hooks into the gender karmas and polarity wars that otherwise can so easily postpone or deny what each one is meant to do.</p>
<p>But most emphatically what I have learned through this arduous task is that the living need much deeper assistance than the old barrier could allow, what they need form us the most is the close accompanying presence of one who holds a clear image of the living soul, and maintains that clarity under any and all circumstances. The wavering ideas and impression people send back and forth to each are crippling, no body can find a steady path way when they are shown themselves at a thousand angles that are mutually contradictory, day in a day out. In fact this is turned out to be an extraordinary discovery. I have learned that what keeps the living soul in bondage is the lack of free reflection of a true and steady kind. The twice born or awakening dead are adept in seeing in knowing and feeling, the once born or awakening living as they truly are, and in keeping this reflection free open and devoid of karmic underpinning, the deepest need the living bring to the dead now is one for of true and real reflection. A sustaining grace of being beheld steadily as who one truly is even if the personal soul of the living momentarily looses track of themselves in the scan of their own awareness. When I took this issue to the highest sources, here what they showed me.</p>
<p>The living poison each other unwittingly by yielding themselves up to ways of seeing and knowing each other that are often false and misleading. This poison is cumulative, once people have experienced enough exposure to false reflection they tune out others in their lives and no longer seek reflection earnestly. But once this happens each one gets trapped in a separative container and is sustainable to their own soul moods and shifts so that few can hold a steady reflection for themselves either. Here is where we who have died can do the most good. I know from my own personal experience that it is easy and natural for me to stay in utmost clarity of perception and beholding at all times. This does wonders and miracles for those I touch. Most dynamically it allows them to breath deeper, to trust their own inner soul, and become intensively aligned with destiny in a free sense. The dead restore the true life rthymns , patterns and tones to the world of the living. We give a pristine reflective sphere for the living to remember and know themselves and find their way through the maze of external events into the heart of life&rsquo;s perfects unfolding.</p>
