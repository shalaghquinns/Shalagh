      <description>&lt;p&gt;we have been taught and formed&#xA;on the need to think about our world through the frame of numbers&#xA;through money through  time&#xA;we want external guarantee and known outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We believe time is something happening outside of us,&#xA;something that the more we plan it,&#xA;the more we know it,&#xA;the more we can guarantee a numerical outcome,&#xA;the more we can receive from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;what if the gift of time is not something we can know and plan?&#xA;what if the gift is in the way it reveals itself to us in a process&#xA;through an internal experience with no external prof&#xA;what if all the need to prove our value stops us from the greatest value&#xA;and the greatest value we have is not something that can be shared with anyone&#xA;how does that change your experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
