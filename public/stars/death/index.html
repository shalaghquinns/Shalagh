Whats it about?</p>
<p>Along with rising interest in spirituality comes an increasing amount of scepticism and withdrawal because of the distance the subject matter carries from our reality. For many the subject of spirituality carries undertones that don&rsquo;t align with the logical and rational world. There exists a gap between the world of spirit and very factual, time, and money driven world that we&rsquo;re working with. As conflict increases within the current climate, so does the need for a solution that integrates the experience of spirit into the rational world. This book deals with the root question that started the discussion of spirit and the one we all face regardless of our beliefs, what happens when we die.</p>
<p>Death doesn&rsquo;t wait for us at the end of our life, it is woven into every step of our existence. This ambient truth of an unknownness forms the basis for how we deal with everything. As much as we know, we still enter everyday into the great and infinite void. No matter how much we can plan each day unfolds as its own created path, unpredictable, unimaginable, and undecided. Death is knocking at our door every day asking the question are we making the most of our time, our experience, is it worthy? Not a day goes by without this influence moving our being. Death is preparing us and moving us through each moment by reminding us that we will leave and gives us a reason to live, to love, and to do what we feel we came for. It is not a final destination, it is our comprehension of life. The two interwoven into each other, without ever knowing each other. This book explores how this perception of death creates our experience of life.</p>
<p>If we believe in a heaven, that we may some day go to a place that is better than where we are, then we form a life that takes less responsibility for our internal experience. We see our experience here as part of a bigger plan and believe that everything that&rsquo;s happening comes from a power much greater than us. This gives us tremendous trust in the world but lacks acknowledging our own individual power.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t believe in anything after we die, we are forced to make the most of our experience here and take complete responsibility for everything that happens to us. We attempt to create the most amount of value of our time and spend our energy planning life to make sure things go right, and not wrong. When we believe there is no greater power taking care of us, we cannot trust the whole of our experience.</p>
<p>This book opens us to a third style of death, that creates a new form of life. A lens that looks at where we are going as both a product of what we create here and a part of the greater whole. It restores the power of spirit with the individual experience. This form of death enables us to both take responsibility for our experience and also trust that we are taken care of.</p>
<p>To explore this world of both, is to experience the reality that we are both creating our own separate experience here, and this experience is woven into the world as a whole together. Where free will, and destiny come together. A world where everything happens for a reason, and every reason is self created. Where the spirit and individual ride together.</p>
<p>Death is where we end up with everything we created here on earth. It is not an escape plan, it is not a not a way out, it is the way in. Where we face that we are both everything that we created here on earth, and a part of everything ever created. The question of what happens when we die, is the same way we deal with what happens each day we live here and how we create it.</p>
<p>Death is not an individual perspective or belief system, it is the reality we can all relate to. Understanding death as interwoven into life gives us lens we can use to address the essence of spirit without it being tied to any systems or religions. Many spiritual views create division and separate us because of different views on god. These differences all stem from what we believe happens after death, and therefore how we are meant to behave on earth. When we can see that it is the unknown experience that connects us all, we can focus on creating a foundation from the unknown, rather than attempting to know our surroundings.</p>
<p>Since we became conscious of our experience here, humans have created structure&rsquo;s, systems, religions and rituals based on the after-life. These systems developed as reflections of the time and place they came from, and emerged in various ways around the globe throughout history. As they grew and we become more connected, conflicts arose because of the differences in these belief systems. In this process we lost touch with the origin of where these systems came from and became programmed to follow a formula that works within the structures, rather than grow from the root of why they arrived.</p>
<p>Religion creates separatism and self intrest. As we pray to our god, and worship a system we center our belief&rsquo;s around the idea that one side is better than the other. This creates a dissonance and contradiction from the fact that we are all a part of this same earth.</p>
<p>a means to take responsibility for our life. If life is death, we can grasp that life is unknown, and that because we can&rsquo;t truly know it, every moment we are in a creative relationship with our experience here. We can deal with death at every moment. Not just waiting for the final moment of our life to flash before our eyes.</p>
<p>We die more and more every day</p>
<p>each second we are dying to who we are,
turning it to who we once were,
as we die
we are reborn
each second we become more of where we came from
and this is our experience of earth,
our memory of what has happened,</p>
<p>the past reflects our death,
with the future of who we&rsquo;re becoming
day after day,
layer by layer</p>
<p>this is our experience of time
the time arises as multiple levels of experience
coming from multiples cycles of time,
each moment is a creation of the next moment,</p>
<p>time is not something random,
it is a sequence,
a season,
it repeats itself in systems
at different rates
plants grow at different time,
women get their periods,
we wake up and go to sleep,
we have generations,</p>
<p>everything is in the repeating
from a reflection of itself,
no time was alone,
never did not belong to the time before it
and the time after it,
time and time again
it went deeper and deeper
inside itself</p>
<p>the memory of time has a rate of cycles,
we rememeber generations as having charastics,
days as having certain feelining,
everything we remeber is a cycle within a cycle,
this is rates of time</p>
