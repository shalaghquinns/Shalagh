    <meta name="description" content="Aries: Taking up where our instinctual drive moves us, testing and finding out how strong we are to extinguish any doubt we have in our capabilities. Discovering inner power.
Taurus: Living with our world our bubble, our familiar pattern, to change direction requires us to slowly integrate into unknown territory. Discovering unknown potential.
Gemini: Consistently and constantly weaving and integrating unknown and known worlds together through our inner known solid interior.
Cancer: Sees the world as a collective, works on the micro for the macro participating in where the collective is moving.
Leo: power of the heart comes to work for the world, inner potential becomes curious about where it comes from .
Virgo: We witness as many sides emerge from within, fine tuning our awareness to become clear about all the sides of the world.
Libra: Each space is its own world, we play into all the sides and external experience&rsquo;s, until the internal world is full enough to be out guiding force. (taking on many sides and versions until the version inside is strong enough to guide us)
Scorpio: Diving deeply inward to self, taking up all the hidden shadows, to clear the karma&gt;
Sag: Life becomes a mystery and we travel through it until the tension between being normal and being wild reveals our true nature.
Capricorn: Embodying full potential and high standards for self, until through sheer force of will we humble ourselves to see everything was a part of our own perfect becoming.
Aquarius: Perceiving the seen and unseen, the greater pattern, working for what we observe while keeping our inner world a mystery.
Pisces: Awake to the mysteries and tapping a creative power that transmutes darkness into rebirth!">
