to describe the pattern of the zodiac</p>
<p>the pattern of the zodiac is often understood
through the signs as as descriptions of characters,
and through the external experience and characteristics of each sign
We talk about the qualities of the Zodiac as the exists on the outside,
the pattern that the creatures symbolize is the internal experience,
and inner process of the signs.</p>
<p>The books provoke us to use our imagination,
to imagination how the internal experience
would create a physical reality.</p>
<p>By keying into each stage of the
creative process step by step
that is unfolding within our experience,
the creatures are designed to go inside</p>
<p>I will use this space
to go into each world within the pattern
and teach how to use these planets
in reflection to our time of birth</p>
<p><strong>lesson one</strong></p>
<p>Patterns in Patterns
everything is a pattern within a pattern,
the 1d cells, create the 2d structure, the 3d structure creates the organism,
and the 4d time creates our experience on earth</p>
<p>time plays a major role in the pattern of creation
(3d worlds video)</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 2</strong>
everything is darkness - Pluto
everything is illusion - Neptune
everything is a reflection - Uranus
everything is creation - Saturn
everything is experience - Jupiter
everything is energy - Mars
everything is a feeling - Moon
everything is love - Venus
everything is connection - Mercury
everything is us - Sun</p>
