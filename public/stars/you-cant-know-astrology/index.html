or used to define and predict this world in a known way,
the possibility is to transform the perception of the reality,
and stitch a deeper meaning into our incredibly personal experience</p>
<p>look around, everyone is living in their
own little universe.
Each one of us born from this planet,
and never left.
everyone is in their own world,
and the space that we came from,
is not a time,
it is an energetic expression</p>
<p>we are not born on a planet,
we are born as the planet,
and as a reflection to the
entire experience
of this system
of souls</p>
<p>it is to obvious,
and yet to much to grasp,
as a foundation to live from.
however it is this understanding,
that remains at the for front of every
experience we have with each,
we are always meeting each other
where we are both at in time
cross sectioning our world
with the outer world
all day everyday,
and out into infinity
but none of this matters if we can
not give the credit to the interior experience</p>
<p>giving credit is a broad turn,
and involves shifting the lens from
the outer world experiences
that gives credit to
people, time, money and known good times,
and learns to give credit to an inner world that is unfolding, through, within and around these
experiences,</p>
<p>when looked through the lens of the stars
with this understanding,
we shift from defining and validating the
observable characteristics of the signs,
and our experience
and can begin to appreciate<br>
layers of consciousness that are
each playing unique roles.</p>
<p>to work with these layers,
we must understand it from
how the internal experience feels<br>
verses how is looks on the outside</p>
<p>astrology has the ability to
become the clock without a face
to be a way we can see and appreciate time
from, when we take off the face of the clock
and notice all the gears turning together as one,</p>
<p>we are approaching a time,
where the time is no longer
making much sense
in the way we remember it,</p>
<p>a clock faced world
now a memory once lived
so we hang in the abis
with no time needed to
fulfill the wish</p>
<p>if we focus on the signs
we are focusing on characteristics<br>
generalized understanding,
when we get into the degrees,
we get into each part of the story
and the individual experience
which is incredibly personal
and impossible to generalizing into
singlar traits,</p>
<p>rather than trend forecasting,
and chart reading,
if we study the degrees we
gather a more intimate feeling of the
each incredibly vast dimensions of existence</p>
<p>each degree is a journey
one must endure
that is a piece in the greater whole
360 degrees,
each one playing
its own vital and unique role
in this incredibly multidimensional place</p>
<p>Because astrology exists within a system,
and as a pattern, astrologers seek to know more about the system,
more about the patterns and believe they can think their way into an understanding,
the reason why I find so much interest in this practise is because it combines a system,
with the power of our imagination and creativity,
only through this lens can we image into the experience,
we are not definitions, points in our chart, or qualities,
we are colours, sensations, combinations, layers,
and experiences</p>
