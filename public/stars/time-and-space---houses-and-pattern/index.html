(time)</p>
<p>when we look at someones chart
we are looking at both the time
and space that they came from.</p>
<p>the space is where in space,
the planets were at the time of birth,
the space will tell us how part of us is behaving
the space is the feeling of what surrounds us,
so the space will show us how parts of us feel,
we where certain outfits, and act as different characters
based on the space we are in
the space will show us how we behave and act</p>
<p>the time is where in time,
the planets were at the time of your birth,
much of our day is governed by our perception
of the time of day,
the time determines how our conciseness behaves,
whether it is acting subconsciously as it sleeps,
or consciously as its awake,
where in our conscious awareness are we acting from
is determined by the time
Time determines our rhythm of the day,
time determines how we spend the energy that we have
these are all the things the &ldquo;houses&rdquo; show us.</p>
