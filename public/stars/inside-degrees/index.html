    <meta name="description" content="Aries 1 - Repairing and building a stone wall

Our instinct is to use the materials of the world to create a boundaries for us to continue working in a straight forward manor
The confrontation of the self with the material world. 
Blocking out the complexities of the world. 
The treasure we are protecting is ourselves, and we know how to move things out of our way. 
We harness of internal strength in a straightforward motion, and love being in direct contact with the next piece needed to see the results of the wall. 
We know what is needed inside, and do not need to justify the creation of the wall to the outside world. 
The use of rocks of all shapes and sizes to find a way for them to fit together so that the self is protected.

<p><strong>Aries 2 -</strong> <em>Stone steps descending into darkness</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>Guided shown and pushed into darkness, yet unsure if we want to go there.</li>
<li>Our subconscious pulls us to the places we want to avoid. </li>
<li>Must find the will inside to take each step or the decent will be slower. </li>
<li>Entering fearlessly, or else feeling the need to rebel against the world like an anger teen. </li>
<li>We are traveling down to retreive the one we forgot. </li>

<li>Recovering our raw soul in its primal essence. </li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know where I am going but I have to get there. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aries 3-</strong> <em>The outer casting of the great pyramid being removed.</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>External shell is stripped away so we can see how sacred we truly are.</li>
<li>Cannot be stopped by external expectations or preexisting limits. </li>
<li>Set on seeing the truth in its flesh, all that is scared is revealed beyond the image or how it seems. </li>

<li>Appearance is not concerned with how it looks, only with bringing destiny through and full.</li>
<li>Fearless and able to follow the inner vision. </li>
<li>The world can be how it wants, but this degree is on its own path. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aries 4 -</strong> <em>A cup overflowing with pure water</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>overflowing need to purify my own expression and outlast my own constraints. </li>
<li>I feel like the cup, filled with my blockages and constraints, but my intention is overcome this so I over flow. Todo so I must take my world and self lightly. </li>
<li>I must remains pure, untouched and uncomplicated. I must remain utterly myself or else it feels as though I am no body at all. I am becoming who I once was </li>
<li>Playful, boundless and free, seeking other souls to mirror this back to me. </li>
<li>I run into my own reflection, still attached to my small mind, yet drawn from all sides to drown out my shadow. I cant be just someone else, I am overflowing with my own essence. </li>
<li>Only trick is not to think, not about self, or world just to wing it and go all the way raw and wild. </li>
</ul>
<p>*<em>Aries <em>5 -</em></em> *A statue of god worn smooth by devotees kissing</p>
<ul>
<li>a focus on the spirit softens and makes the hardness disappear. </li>
<li>We are a spirit force and come up against of hardness, the image and the need to be the hero</li>
<li>The feeling of having to live up to our potential. </li>
<li>Our humanness comes in direct physical contact with the spirit forces, we are both the devotee and the statue of god, only concerned with combining the 2. </li>
<li>An intense commitment and drive to move through anything that gets in our way. </li>
<li>Cutting through the crap to meet god on the lips, keeping the pressure of the kiss on. </li>
<li>Not bowing down to spirit and instead meeting it with passion. </li>
<li>Discovering through love that spirit is all sides and not playing into any one version of religion. </li>
<li>I am too much, I am all at once, every and all, unable to hide from the feeling that I am here. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aries 6</strong> - <em>An aqua marine in a women&rsquo;s navel.</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>Power of spirit moves through the navel and we must move with-it where ever it takes us. </li>
<li>We can feel the power and contact with the earth so strongly that we want others to feel it to. </li>
<li>Delighting in provoking and pushing the shared current to get the waters moving </li>
<li>I am activated by by potential, I know what I must do. </li>
<li>Moving with this sensation is my only job, my life purpose to embody this electricity.</li>
<li>If I go against this power then I am robbed of my energy.</li>
<li>Goes against most of the flow of the external world. Not pretending to fit in and asking the same of others. </li>
<li>Cannot hide our animal instinct. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aries 7</strong> - <em>Double headed eagle, heads facing opposite directions.</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>The sharpness of seeing has 2 edges. The conscious direction is powerful, but is being melted through exposure to the whole.  </li>
<li>All our explanations and validity to how we see things looses its grip and we must welcome in each moment with exactly what is there.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gemini 29</strong> - <em>a garden planted solely with shade plants</em></p>
<ul>
<li>we are protecting and penetrating to nurture what cant be seen. </li>
<li>When the brightness of the surface world has pulled us far enough out there, we have been stretched and grown enough externally, to be able to provide shade to what is out of the light and beyond reason </li>
<li>switching to a slower timeline. </li>
<li>Love knowing we are discovering a place others miss, and it pushes us to track down further. </li>
<li>We track the darkness, becoming obsessives and consumed by the shadow.</li>
<li>Nurturing this space intensively eventually grows towards the light, bringing forth unseen gifts. </li>
<li>Emersion into the dark gives us a fuller understanding and appreciation for the depths of light. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gemini 30</strong>- <em>Many glass elements on a shelf</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>The micro world is a reflection of the macro world. The big picture is seen in tiny moments and made into our prized possession. </li>
<li>The surface and common aspects of life become packed with meaning and significance. We hold on to our accomplishments, and everything we have come to already as if this is enough. </li>
<li>Drawn into the fascination of the exterior and lacking interest in diving into the new. </li>
<li>Focus is on the memory, we have traded the soul experience for the image, everything is on the same surface level. </li>
<li>We must see though these accomplishments and our many gifts, which we can display forever. </li>
<li>We must remember the shape and forms of the surface. Finding significance in the surface is our gift alone, and that to others this deep meaning we feel is only a passing image. </li>
<li>We must imagine that we are alone here and then we can find out we are the creator and the key to our depth. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cancer 1</strong> <em>- a potter at work</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>There is a pattern that forms when we can hold in our being the force central force for it to be revealed. </li>
<li>Through practice and conscious attunement to the senses. We can hold the form with ease and with trust and the spirit forces will be revealed. </li>
<li>Through discipline, and going through the steps and stages, we train our senses, and spirt forces come streaming through as a full bodied experience. A witnessing intelligence, trust in the forces of earth, a remembering without the need to think about it. </li>
<li>Joining forces with nature to become an instrument for all to use. </li>
<li>In our studio we block out what ever we don&rsquo;t want and protect our gifts as they move through us. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cancer 2 -</strong> <em>A bunch of iron keys</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>We feel the immense responsibility for holding the key for everyone to open the door.</li>
<li>There are many keys on the chain, we are unsure of ourselves which part will open. So we must find a way to convince every part of ourselves of its own worth. </li>
<li>We find an intense focus on this inside job, and others may find us emotionally removed. </li>
<li>We are our own unique form, iron and ridged,  designed to find our own door. </li>
<li>An ability to go through places others cannot see, we have an access to a higher power, through patience and resourcefulness. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cancer 3</strong> - <em>A set of Surgical Instruments</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Precisely designed to address the worst of the situation, called to deal with the extremes. </li>
<li>Focused and tapped to be the one that intervenes last minute, with the power to open the door within. </li>
<li>Strange forces accompany us calling us under. As we follow then their depth increases the more light we give them </li>
<li>We are perfectly deigned and fitted for the places we go, and as we enter the importance of our repair job becomes clear and necessary. </li>
<li>The darkness shows us that there was nothing wrong or unnecessary, and were there for us to remember and ignite our golden touch. 
-  We cant stop addressing the problem and diving into the memory of a solution. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cancer 4</strong> - <em>Weeping willows by a pond</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>we are protected from the external world, time goes on without us as we stare into the reflection of the pond, trying on different versions of ourselves seperated from the external world . We are taken care of by life, but not pushes to explore outwards. </li>
<li>We belong to the familiar environment that surrounds and encloses us, as we stare into the reflection of the water, we wonder who we might be.</li>
<li>We can bring down many elements from this world, as they grow into this reflection of the pond. The tree stretches down to the pond it must expand outwards as well as grow beyond the close comfort. </li>
<li>As we grow more comfortable unto yourself we can ultimately bring more strands of knowledge down, and unite them together. </li>
<li>The tree holds onto the core memory of its being as it expand into the world. We are shaded and protected here, amongst everything we are becoming. The more we can be within the world internally the more we can expand outwards. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cancer 5 -</strong> <em>trap door under a rug</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>The world outside seems normal and yet we are constantly slipping into greater depths than what originally seemed and in the places we resist going. </li>
<li>Our instinct is to externalize ourselves and express outwardly, achieving concrete goals, and ignoring what we don&rsquo;t want to see. Another side persists and knows we are doing this to hide from a part of ourselves. </li>
<li>Superstitious and magnetically drawn to sniff out the secret places, even if it goes against our initial perception of things. We are resistant, yet mesmerized. We don&rsquo;t want to go against ourselves, but we must.  </li>
<li>The inner truth will be reveled, we need a sense of humor to keep falling into our own traps.</li>
<li>Resistant to what we don&rsquo;t want to see, yet forced to go there anyway. We must use hidden places to retreat from the complexities of the world which keep us distracted and surface level</li>
