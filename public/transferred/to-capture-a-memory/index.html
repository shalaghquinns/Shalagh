<em>To become ignited by a memory,</em>
<em>we yearn into the moment to remember the feeling</em>
<em>and seek to recreate it again.</em></p>
<p>As we peel back the experience of a memory it quickly revels itself as our vision for the future. Each step we take, each move we make is based on the memory of where we are going, of what we are doing. There is no present moment, there is only a memory of the past, reflected as a vision for the future.</p>
<p><em>a vision for the future</em></p>
<p>The screen is our memory and our vision for the future - it is the world we seek to create. The world we choose to share shapes the world we want to live in. The people we follow mirror back the world we wish to create for ourself, and the memories shared inspire us to live into our vision.</p>
<p>The vision we are sharing is a final product. We bring people along to give them the final result, the end destination, something worthy and of value. So whats the repercussion of of creating a memory that is always trying to tell us something, to give us the answers we seek to create.</p>
<p>We ask the world to create a memory for us. We turn to our world to give us the answer, we get off the screen and see the world through boxes of what we believe has the most resale value.</p>
<p><em>We look to the world to give us something to take a photo of.</em></p>
<p>We look through the lens of our world, through a screen, through what we can make from it, from its external value, from its numerical response online. We look to create moments of the most value, and then seek out from our world what seems like it will get the most approval. What moment can promote more moments that are the best moments.</p>
<p>This collective nightmare is more obvious in the world of influencers, most humans are becoming more curious about their relationship with the phone. However I feel it important to expose this trend because even if we are not sharing our lives like influences, we are watching this content and its weaving our way into our physic experience.</p>
<p><em>When we put ourselves in boxes of how we seem to others
we put our selves in boxes of how we seem to ourself.</em></p>
<p>In this process we have forgotten where the true value is in life and what it means to practise appreciating our own individual unique experience.
To practise appreciating our unique experience in the world, we can practise sharing it to our world.
To do this we must change the root behaviour behind why we choose to share.</p>
<p><em>When we share for the eyes of others,</em>
<em>we see ourself in the eyes of others.</em>
<em>When we share for the eyes of our inside world,</em>
<em>we see ourself in the eyes of our inner world.</em></p>
<p>To shift the current of the world of social media that inspires us,
we must learn to go against the ways the its corrupting us.
Social media uses the self against itself,
through the creation of world that seek to get approved by more and more numbers,
seeking approval from our world, only promotes others to do the same,
when we do not share for the approval of others,
we give ourself and others the permission to do the same</p>
