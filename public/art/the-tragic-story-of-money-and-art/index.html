<p>money puts the fire out on our imagination,</p>
<p>the final realization
came after so much time,
itself had no real value,
it was just the death that
made me realize that from before.
that allowed me to move forward,
but the realization was nothing
compared to the journey
it took me to get there.
it was just the great joke,
the final punch line to an experience that
had been playing itself out to me</p>
<p>I asked for it
to be chained up,
and create my own way through,
to become all the external world,
I had to become the external fantasy
to do the best i could for others to see,
just to say fuck that joke
im sorry i lied to you,
I was playing a game
thats not me,
I am much more insane
than my outer sanity may have proclaimed,
Im just crazy in an outer way,
so my inner sanity can stay the same.</p>
