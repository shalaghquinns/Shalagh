its an experiment
to see if I could trust in time
to see if I could let my inner world be,
what would it have to show me
to see what the creative process had to say when I trusted in it,</p>
<p>what i learned was, this process did not want to be planned,<br>
when I surrendered I was given something
beyond what I could have expected
the process wants to remain unknown
when I didn&rsquo;t confine the experience to money or numbers or time,
It always led me to create a different exchange
that allowed something much stronger to flow through</p>
<p>I create because it is my hearts deep intent
to share that we are all a part of a creative process
that we must participate in
there is a radical and crazy journey each individual on earth has signed up for,
and it is our responsibility to recognize this and support the weirdness
of the unknown experience that is being on earth.</p>
<p>I figured if I made the art then this was the creative process,
but the process of creating art was only a fraction of the experience,
in-fact it was the perception of my experience that what fuelled the art.
behind the art was years of growth and
change being given a voice,
being given a platform to speak through
to make sense the experience internally
which didn&rsquo;t have a voice in in the outer world.
art was the way I practised listening and attending to my instincts,
putting layers of colours on the walls was a way build on my intuition,
to practise trusting and watching it come to life.
each piece was a reflection of the world that surrounded me
and each piece drew me further into trusting that world
the conversations and the people i met through painting
were pushing me forward,
they were the prof and the evidence that I was not alone in this journey,
they were my world too and they supported me to keep me see through,
I got food, places to stay, I made friends and I talked about art
I loved doing it in the real world.</p>
<p>when i began practising it was an experiment
trust in each line and each stroke,
just to follow the process of each layer of colour, onto the next
I painted to watch what I felt,
come to life on its own terms,
I practised watching it unfold with each stroke,
it allowed the world to do the same,
and I was wimaltainously streaching and expanding the boundaires of my own reality at the same time, to paint began to form its own meaning for me, that refinorced my ability to find meaning in my own world,
it deepen the capacity to see meaning,</p>
<p>to make art is to notice,
and to experience the next dimension of noticing,
for when we give action to what we notice,
to what we experience,
then the experience changes,
it begins to become you, and communicate it self through you,
weave yourself in tandem with the world,</p>
<p>we are this world,
we are not born on this planet we are born as this planet, we are born to become it,
so we create. so we absorb and express
as a part of it.
the absorbsion does not make sense at first,
because it is the absorption that is the creation of senses, art is the creation of</p>
