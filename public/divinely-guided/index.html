They bring out my power, showing me it is huge. They bring up my fear of the size, they bring up the possibility of balance between the two.</p>
<p>I went my whole life being trapped in a world I didn&rsquo;t understand and I didn&rsquo;t feel I belonged to. Surrounded by a problem I could not grasp, by a world that was to powerful for me to handle. I hid from the size of the earth, i hid from my dream, I has to hide, I had to blend in, I had to get along.</p>
<p>So thats what I did, thats what I knew how to do, what I learned, to get along with my world, to make friends with the world even though a part of me itched to change every thing about it, I stayed inside and waited.</p>
<p>One night in Nepal, the two most beautiful men I had ever seen walked into the bar during an open mic. Across the table from my sister and I were the only 2 open seats, where they sat down and nonchalantly introduced themselves. Everything was casual until we asked where they were from, and their answer was Israel. I didn&rsquo;t know what I should say. I knew very little about the war going on only that it was a complicated situation. Our response triggered the one I had instantly fallen in love with.</p>
<p>He was a boy with a big smile and warm eyes. He wore the kind of mysterious confidence that felt a little too good for the world. His initial warm smile began to contrast the coldness I could feel. Never the less, I could feel my heart tell me that I loved this man.</p>
<p>I washed this feeling off again, after coming back from getting a drink with his friend down stairs named Tom. I saw him sitting next to my sister in deep conversation and though he might be into her. It didn&rsquo;t matter anyways because Tom and I had just witnessed the most hilarious and shocking experience.</p>
<p>Tom and were posted up against the wall next to a steep staircase waiting for our beers. For the first time in so long I could feel like I was looking into the eyes of someone who understood me, of someone who could see me, of someone who was listening. They were kind, and brown and deep, he stood there presently. His expression reflected how I was feeling, his response ignited me more, his story pulled me in. Then suddenly a loud thud next to us, as the body of a 200 pound male lands flat on his face from the top of the steep staircase. We are both shocked  Everyone crowds around as the drunk man slowly stands to his feet and walks out of the bar.</p>
