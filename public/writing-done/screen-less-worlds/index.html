in this world,

to put what you imagination into action,
we must work into the vision of
what we want to see happen

to make sense from non sense
we have to create how we sense,
to give life to the unknown,

the conversation between our senses

<p>in this world,
anything you want to create
you must find it in reality,
you must engage in the steps forward
to put what you imagination into action,
we must work into the vision of
what we want to see happen
we have to make sense of the problem,
to make sense from non sense</p>
<p>we have to create how we sense,
to give life to the unknown,
and along the way,
the conversation between our senses
stitches together the known and unknown,
and the process becomes a dance,
of revealing itself.</p>
<p>we feel at home here
on earth
in this dance,
we feel supported,
we feel connected,
we feel a part of the experience,</p>
<p><strong>art is creating our</strong>
<strong>own sense of the world,</strong></p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter what it is
it doesn&rsquo;t matter what it looks like</p>
<p>its in the process of creating it,
we are making up our senses,
we are forging a path,
based on our internal freedom
about how we want to envision this life</p>
<p>by putting the vision into action,
we become active participants
in the sensory experience of the world</p>
<p>we come to touch our experience
from the inside out</p>
<p>the intuitive experience stems from
looking at how your internal world responds to its environment
rather than how you are responding to your external world</p>
<p>we have so much beautiful art out there
and amazing creations
everything our senses crave to create
can met by the screen</p>
<p>but this does not satisfy our creative expression
and instead blocks us from being creativity engaged with the world
because the screen world appears more interesting</p>
<p>we need to stop staying stuff on here
designed to help other make sense of an external reality,</p>
<p>we want to make so much sense to someone
that they make new sense of them self<br>
so we try very hard to make sense to others
and forget we are the only ones making sense of this place anyways</p>
<p>we are infinity
tied into tiny human bodies,
here to comprehend karma,
so that the sun can have energy to shine</p>
