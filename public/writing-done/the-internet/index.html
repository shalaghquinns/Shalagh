to be a valid human
to get numbers and confirm we are accepted
we use technology factually, realistically</p>
<p>the internet is something we take seriously
as a reflection of our identity
its not a place to be something you&rsquo;r&rsquo;e not
we share to put our best foot forward</p>
<p>we like and follow each other
to reinforce that we are having a
valid human experience here
and the closer you can follow a formula,
the more it appears you are connected to humanity</p>
<p>this is all one side of the coin,
the internet is a valuable place for many things
but we must find ways of actually integrating it into our awareness,
before it swallows all true creativity</p>
<p>one of the most predominate shifts
that technology and the internet as had on
humanity, has been our creativity</p>
<p>while the potential for our imagination
has been stretched into infinity
simultaneously these systems have created boundaries
around creative expression and thinking</p>
<p>creativity has become a form of social approval
we use our creative energy to gain numbers
and expression is displayed through curated feeds,
carefully designed characters, brands, styles, and
a form of algorithmic thinking that shapes
our creative experience around the perspective of others</p>
<p>in the process of watching screens
and creating content for screens
our sensory experience is stretched from inside us
into the external world of exterior perspectives,</p>
<p>we work to create for the masses.
but this is not the primal creative expression,
this is not the clear direct stream from inner experience,
to outer expression,</p>
<p>for this expression contains within it a mirror,
that as it creates, it sees itself,
and as it see&rsquo;s itself
we create for what we see
we create for what we want
we create for a reason
we create because we want others to see us
and the art becomes a reflection
of our reflection</p>
<p>we see ourself as the reflection,
but we are tied,
we are tied to our past,
to each stroke,
when we do it for the image
we can not escape what we share,</p>
<p>it is true that what we create is a reflection,
but when we create for the reflection of the outer world,
we remain stuck in this world, in a version of how it should be,
when we create through an inner world,
without knowing where its taking us,
without caring how it looks or what it means to anyone but us,
we deepen into ourself,
and we recognize that this inner world,
is the outer world</p>
<p>in this deepening conversation we become more intertwined into the outer experience,
it begins to show up for us as we created it inside,
the creation becomes a manifestation,
because it is created from the feeling, not the image.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to manifest the image of how something looks,
for the image will not take us any where,
we must imagine how something feels,
work with that feeling,
make it real, give it a name,
an account, a timeline,
give it a colour, a photo, a drawing,
writing, sewing, playing, whatever
you need to do to make the feeling inside real,
and it will become real for you,
in time,
down the line.</p>
<p>the perfect post</p>
<p>it was the perfect post,
the moment had been captured,
the fun was made real,
the beauty of  life had been justified.</p>
<p>the lighting hit our face at the exact right angle,
the colours matched,
it seemed real, not to forced,
like we didn&rsquo;t even have to try,
like we didn&rsquo;t even care if we did try.</p>
<p>Life felt better when it looked this good back to us,
life felt meaningful when we had the image to show for it,
life felt right when others approved our image,
as long as it looked good on the outside,
everything was fine.</p>
<p>cut the bullshit.
I know we&rsquo;re not suppose let someone know when we know they are lying to us. I know we&rsquo;re suppose to nod our head and pretend we don&rsquo;t know they aren&rsquo;t telling the truth. I know Im suppose to play along with this game, but Im getting scared. Im getting really worried about our world, and I think this game is causing a lot of harm.
I know because I played it, I know because i got really good at faking it. I know because I created a life that looked really good on the outside, and I was using it to hide from myself. When I found what I was hiding from it took years of uncovering how deeply I had gone. Now I am free, now I can share without getting anybody liking it and I can still know I am moving in the right direction. Now I can bring my heart forward without trying to make it make sense to anyone. Now I have created and shared enough stuff without the need to be approved to share in full confidence that it brings me closer to my world to my reality, and to my own game here.</p>
<p>so i want to say something about the perfect post.
when we think we have found an image or a clip that captures our life how we want others to see,
this becomes a sort of standard, we become our own little god to worship.
Our identity and the way we see this image becomes how we want others to see us,
we behave in the same way as the image, with a hyper awareness that we are being watched,
we behave like a camera could come at any moment and try and capture that standard,
we behave like we are in a movie.</p>
<p>I think this experience is noticeable when we look back at footage from earlier years before social media and people seem much more fluid and less self conscious in their environment. No one is as hyper aware of them selves as they are today. We are meant to be interacting with life, not with the way life seems. So the more we feed into this image</p>
