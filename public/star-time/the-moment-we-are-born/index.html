and since that moment
we never left,
since the time of our birth
we have been living in our own entirely unique world,
in conjunction to everyone else&rsquo;s entirely unique experience</p>
<p>if you really look at people
you will see something amazing is happening,
each person is in their entire own universe,
the one moment they have been in
since the day they were born,
the same moment
the one they they have created,
everything thing that they are,
stems from the moment they were created</p>
<p>and in the moment of our birth
the moment we come concious to our world
we become one with it,
one with the moment that we will live for the rest of our life
and when we become one with it,
we become one with not only the world,
but the stars and the planets that surround us.</p>
<p>we become one with the current of the solar system
the stream of creation
and from that moment we transform in relationship to our world,</p>
<p>we become the experience
and slowly merge back to the whole as we die
and in this becoming the world becomes along side us,
we work together to create something,
and we emerge from the earth,
just like a tree,
with every branch, and leaf,
and curve and root,
born from the moment
we emerge from the darkness,</p>
<p>and since then
each moment we have been creating this world
each one of us having our own create unique individual world
yet shared with the world around them</p>
<p>we must come to learn from this fact,
that each one of us is its own universe
in its own world
here todo its own amazing and unique job</p>
<p>we must give people the chance to see their birth
for its own right,
without any preconceived
notions beleif systems
ideas about what it is suppose to look like</p>
<p>birth is a part of a larger process,
one we can trust in, and surrender towards<br>
an unknown stream that has its own
unique destiny unfoldment,
that has never been done before
our identity is an unknown maze,
and our time on earth is the gift we are given to explore it</p>
<p>being born is the most creative moment we will ever experience
for just like each moment of our life,
it is not just the moment that creates us,
but us that creates the moment,
and therefore this moment
becomes the moment we create
our life on earth,</p>
<p>we can look to the stars to understand
the pattern of creation
and by seeing ourself within it
we can learn to own the role for the internal experience
that is speaking to us.</p>
<p>the only experience we have ever had,
and never left.
and each one of us the same,
in an entirely different world.
and entirely differnet experince,
in the same world,</p>
<p>everyone is having their own personal unique experince
each one of us, forming the world,
our knowing, our truth
there is no fact in the nature
nothing is truly true
everything we experince is a perception
when we can reconize that reality is subjective</p>
<p>what i want it to see like,</p>
<p>birth is the experience that creates us,
our conciseness experience
is always in reflection to the moment we
were created
each person is having there own unique experince based on the time the came from</p>
