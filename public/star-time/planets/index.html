<p>the solar system in a system of time
greater than the one we have on earth.
each of these layers is a part of a pattern we share
we are each different reflections of the same pattern</p>
<p>Deeper breakdown</p>
<p>each paragraph is describes a layer in the pattern, that is a layer in our conciseness.
The planets each create a different layers of the conscious experience of being on earth.</p>
<p>Firstly we must see that everything is unknown. We will never reach a point where we know whats going on here. The more we know, the more we know we don&rsquo;t know, and we&rsquo;re all facing the same unknown outcome anyways. There is a forever void inside and we are made to develop a relationship to that void, and to learn what it gives us. Death is the fuel to bring us to life. This unknownness in each of us drives us to discover each day, never reaching a final destination, only going is deeper and deeper inside. The more we deepen our relationship to this depth and the more we follow it, the more the darkness speaks our language and the way the darkness feels begins to change.</p>
<p>From this darkness we imagine into our world. Everything is imagination, the more we follow and trust the dark the greater we can imagine. All day we imagine into the world. There is a shared feeling in the atmosphere, there is a story we are participating in together with those around us, and this is the illusion. The feeling that we are all in the same world, but in reality it&rsquo;s all being imagined. Our imagination runs through our senses, it tunes us into this world. We get glimpses outside of the illusion through psychedelic experience where our senses are tuned just a little differently, and we begin to sense and see an unknown world much vaster. Everything perceived from the darkness runs through the stream of our imagination comes through a vision, a feeling and a sense. If we do not listen to this inner sense, we will be pulled into the outer story, into the scrolling, and films and news to tell us this story for us. We will never escape our imagination, but we can attempt the let something else do it for us. This side of us is the space we crave to dream.</p>
<p>From this dream we see that our experience that the world is a refection of what illusion we are going through. When we can see that we are creating we are drawn closer to discover our truth, which is a never ending reflection. This teaches us to see our selves and to take responsibility for our experience instead of instead of blaming the world. We are shocked into reality, we are in creative relationship with it, we are discovering what we are capable of, we are seeing what we create. If we don&rsquo;t take responsibility for this feeling we feeling true to self. We give ourself over the the world and let it act for us. When we take responsibility for the inner reflection, we do not give our power outside to the feeling that all of this us happening to us, and we see that we are creating all of it.</p>
<p>When we can see that we are creating all of it, we can learn to learn from it. We can see it all as our teacher and enjoy the process of learning about ourself in everything we do. It all turns into the fuel for our becoming. When we see we are creating this than we are less reliant on the world systems and structures to create our experience. We can create our own structures and systems, and then we change our relationship to time. We don&rsquo;t need to plan the time, because we engage in the reflection of every day and see that the time is taking us to create the experience we are having here. Then we connect with our truth, because the world we create turns out to be more and more a reflection of whats happening inside. The experience of truth is not a final destination of feeling in the moment, it is a deepening process where your inner world feels more and more in authentic relationship with the external world. Where what we created inside is the way the outer world feels.</p>
<p>When we create and learn from this inner world we are giving infinite insight to grow and expand our experience. We are given from our truth and its lessons the gift to believe in ourself. The ability to expand on who we are and take it further and further. The ability to form a way for us to grow more and more. If we rely on the external world to do this than we trust in algorithms, and schools and formulas and all the systems we created on earth to expand on our beliefs. We attempt to plan and formulate our time and our expansion and ascension. Our expansion is cut off by the minds need to know. When we cant trust our world, and the reflection of our experience, and everything we learn from then the growth is determined by the world around us, not within us. When we can use the previous principals then the gate for expansion opens and we can form our beliefs without needing to project them on to the world. This give us infinite space and empathy to take our belief&rsquo;s to the next level without being burdened by what the world is going through.</p>
<p>We can then take our growth and form it into action. We are allocated the power inside to act on our beliefs, to enter into the adventure of the world and discover how it feels inside us. We are moved to bring these experiences into our body, to let them give us the power to become. To let what moves us, move us, to stand inside of our truth and take ownership for our experience. Our desire to create movement, to give action comes from a desire to get inside the situation. We know that if we want to create any change her we have to create a feeling inside ourself and others. The reason we express anger is to get under someone else&rsquo;s skin. If we are using our action and energy to activate external, rather than internal results then we are continuing to give this power away. This is the feeling of wasting energy to get somewhere, and realizing it&rsquo;s not where we wanted to go. If we use the energy to tune ourself deeper into ourself, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter where we end up - we have learned to enjoy the journey.</p>
<p>Once we have the power to embody and take action, we end up in a body here on earth. In this earthly experience we are brought into tune with the current of the earth. We experience we are a part of a cycle that moves and flows. We are a part of a feeling, we are in the rhythm of being here on earth. When we tap this rhythm we connect to our inner world. Our inner world helps to guide us and move us through time. We become the time here, we tap the worlds in worlds, the subtle feelers. We are pulled into our inner soul journey. We are touched by life, by the mood, the feeling. If we do not listen to these feelings arising inside, they become overwhelming, and seem to meet us as other experience&rsquo;s outside of ourself.</p>
