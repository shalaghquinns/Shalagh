      <description>&lt;p&gt;we want our life to mean something&#xA;we need a reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the reason was survival.&#xA;Now we are here surviving,&#xA;doing much more than just surviving&#xA;and we still need a reason.&#xA;we can&amp;rsquo;t bare being helpless&#xA;for it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense&#xA;to just be here and not have hope&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;hope waits around each corner,&#xA;hope has many streams of awareness inside&#xA;like a dice, hope has many sides,&#xA;something is bound to land&#xA;like a dice, the hope is cut by corners&#xA;and edges that slice it into a shape with sides&#xA;we loose the whole picture&#xA;the meaning is fragmented&#xA;cut by the need for numbers,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;science likes to recognize alot of the characteristics about the physical reality,&#xA;turns out the more we notice about how the physical reality work,&#xA;the more we can know how to make it work for us,&#xA;in this quest for more and more knowledge,&#xA;we forgot to look and seek deeper into the question of why?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;not why plants go through photosynthesis,&#xA;and all the deeper and deeper ways&#xA;that this creates and expresses whats going on around us,&#xA;but why does any of this happen,&lt;/p&gt;</description>
