turns out the more we notice about how the physical reality work,
the more we can know how to make it work for us,
in this quest for more and more knowledge,
we forgot to look and seek deeper into the question of why?</p>
<p>not why plants go through photosynthesis,
and all the deeper and deeper ways
that this creates and expresses whats going on around us,
but why does any of this happen,</p>
<p>to seek this answer
we must zoom out on all our collected data,
and notice the foundational evidence is there are patterns
moving the energy all the time,
everything in science is existing within a pattern</p>
<p>we do not know where any of these patterns originate,
as they cross weave and deeply pull the imagination,
rules remain, amongst the chaos of the mind
everything is interconnected
something always remains unknown
all discoveries lead to deeper and deeper understanding of a pattern
everything as a layer within a pattern
through this deduction</p>
<p>we can say that there is an unknown energy
working through this world all the time
through the experience of pattern
manifesting in many layers all at once</p>
<p>This description encompasses all lessons we can learn
learn about our world,
and teaches us that the world is
happening inside ourself</p>
<p>we are the layers of self
making sense of our self</p>
<p>the self is not an identity,
it is an experience</p>
