we need a reason.</p>
<p>For a long time, the reason was survival.
Now we are here surviving,
doing much more than just surviving
and we still need a reason.
we can&rsquo;t bare being helpless
for it doesn&rsquo;t make sense
to just be here and not have hope</p>
<p>hope waits around each corner,
hope has many streams of awareness inside
like a dice, hope has many sides,
something is bound to land
like a dice, the hope is cut by corners
and edges that slice it into a shape with sides
we loose the whole picture
the meaning is fragmented
cut by the need for numbers,</p>
<p>numbers fragment the mind</p>
<p>books try and convince us
sentence by sentence building on something that makes
logical sense they bring us along in a story,
we read and they tell us what to think
our thoughts become the book, and we enjoy how its presented in a way
that our mind can lay back on a merry go round,
to be constantly fed information into our head.</p>
<p>We greatly enjoy the pleasure of being fed information.
The sooth of the mind as it relaxes
into a constant feed
of what ever meets my need,</p>
<p>This comes from our need to feel a part of whats happening here,
the system of liking and watching a stream is a symptom of this need,</p>
<p>The number enforces the story,
and the story enforces the numbers
and together we go round around around
until the whole world is created and defined by me
and all the power we&rsquo;ve given make meaning
is in the hands of this tiny phone game we&rsquo;re are playing,</p>
<p>the only way to change the game,
is to play the change</p>
<p>We are helpless to a system,
sure delete your social media,
or rebel against the way its tried to control us
how its taken away our ability to make meaning from the world,
notice how it stops you from sharing your truth to your friends,
notice how it keeps us participating in a formula,
notice how this participation hinders your creativity
notice the box it has put you in
and break free</p>
<p>participate to free yourself
participate to engage in another reason to make</p>
