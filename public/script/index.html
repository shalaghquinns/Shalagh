look around you,

no one has ever left,

<p>welcome to the creative sea
where everything you see
is an experience
a product of Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity
everything is an experience relative to it self
what happens when we turn that fact into our creative reality
then everything becomes a personal experience
a perceptive event
everything is diluted into the senses
the bodily experience coming from many layers
coming through our senses, sight, hearing, touch, smell
coming through our perception of time,
the past, the future, the now and nothingness,
each person has been living under the spell
of their own creative trance
since the moment they were born
and since this moment is the only trackable reference
we have of where this experience began
and since we can see how everything is a perception,
we can see the only trackable difference we have
is the difference in the times we came from
the only thing that is real,
is birth and death,
everything else is made up from us,
the only thing we have no control over,
is the time we will die
and the time we are born</p>

      <p>the process zine is like a joke
in that i never know where its going on,
but it always has a punch line to give me,
a funny way that makes everything it did before
make sense</p>
<p>this project as a metaphor for trusting the creative process,
I wanted to see what was meant to learn from this process and the project
because the creative stream I would use to practise documenting and following this thing i trusted so deeply in,
the process,
and what happened was a deepening,
each layer would open me into a vaster understanding,
I began by eliminating any timeline I had on the project,
then I had to eliminate the need to share the process,
then it opened into many streams and sides
I began breaking down the natural process of creation through the stars
and creating my own language which taught me I had to
find another way of understanding this experience
and then I had to loose the need to understand it and wrap my head around it,
and now I am playing through multiple streams
different games on different layers of experiences
in things we call instagram accounts
and each one signifies a different layer of my conscious experience</p>

      <p>the process zine is a tricky game I am playing with myself
as this world
it evolves using my reality as a test subject
to see if the truth of my one great knowing will arrive
if i use every second as a reason for it to exist,
if I can find the memory of why i am here in every moment
I am somewhere
one layer
always on the hunt
to discover how to trust myself more
how to find another reason that this reality is on my side
and believe that it has my best intentions
by believing this I am taken on a journey through every twist and turn
to bring me at rapid hurdling speed
towards a destiny that is mine to give
but it wont let down the performance,
the act of how to do so,
for it is not only paving the way,
it is leaving a trail
as evidence of creativity using itself to pull
itself from darkness
of the great pain and incredible power of how to do your destiny.</p>
