as this world
it evolves using my reality as a test subject
to see if the truth of my one great knowing will arrive
if i use every second as a reason for it to exist,
if I can find the memory of why i am here in every moment
I am somewhere
one layer
always on the hunt
to discover how to trust myself more
how to find another reason that this reality is on my side
and believe that it has my best intentions
by believing this I am taken on a journey through every twist and turn
to bring me at rapid hurdling speed
towards a destiny that is mine to give
but it wont let down the performance,
the act of how to do so,
for it is not only paving the way,
it is leaving a trail
as evidence of creativity using itself to pull
itself from darkness
of the great pain and incredible power of how to do your destiny.</p>
<p>the more simply complex answer on earth,</p>
<p>to be or not to be,
that is the question,</p>
<p>the answer of how to do your destiny
is to be,
as to allow,
is to be there enough to be open t something wanting to move through you,
it is to be humble, and brave, and soft, and forgiving,
it is to allow your body the space so that whats coming through cane arrise
its simple,
and its a complex world to try and digest</p>
<p>one could make the argument that humanity
is at where the mind takes up to much space thinking about the self,
and who it is and what it&rsquo;s doing here on earth.
And there have been periods like this before, after societies have developed past the need to put all their energy into work, then they can begin to think,
we are in an age of thinking, and the age of thinking is part of the consciousness
shift, not the physical shifts, or weather shifts, but a shift in the way we think about life,
this changes the foundation for growth, our thoughts nourish the soil that births
the creation of physical form. As we stretch the way we&rsquo;re conceiving the world,</p>
