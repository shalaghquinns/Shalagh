the birthing of the unknown,
the understanding we receive from our experience
the world that becomes itself along the way,
promising us we are a part of something</p>
<p>we have supplanted a plan
in place of unknown potential
and in the form of a clock,
trust in an undercurrent,</p>
<p>we pretend that time is a constant speed,
that it is something we have control of,
something we can make ours,
our time is our identity, our memory,
and tracking it is the way we
grip hold of this planet as it
apparently spins out of control</p>
<p>or thats what the time would tell us.</p>
<p>these times would have us believing
the world is ending, how could anything
get back on track,
well it wont, and never will ride the same track
of social sanity and order ever again.</p>
<p>because we have come into a different world,
when we&rsquo;ve lost the ability to comprehend
a solution or hope for this situation,
when nothing about all the facts adds up
and we can no longer make sense or whats going on,
we are forced to forge a new path to make sense of this world
by questioning this external reality we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>because we have lost control of the time
after all the fun in 2020</p>
<p>,
something we want to save
something that we want to work our
whole lifes around finding
a definition that we can label to money,</p>
<p>but time has a different definition
itself a multidimensional experience,
just like our bodies,
just like the cells we came from</p>
<p>each cell born on earth,
is born with the purpose to serve
the creation of its following dimension,</p>
<p>the 1d skin cell is born to create the form of the 2d tissue,
the 2d tissue is designed to build the 3d form,
the 3d form creates energy to propel
the 4th dimension, time.</p>
<p>the cell is a reflection of the tissue,
the tissue is a reflection of the form,
and the form is a reflection of the time,
and the time is a reflection of the pattern ,
and the pattern is the way we can see identify the time,
so we must see this is more than just time,
this is a pattern,
that we are a part of,</p>
<p>the time we have on earth,
is not something to attemt to make sense of ,
we use up alot of energy attemping to grasp each day,
when we let go of the planning we see that it has a journey already planned for us,
all it takes is reaching into each moment and
check to see how you are creating it</p>
