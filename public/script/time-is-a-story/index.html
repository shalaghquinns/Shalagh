(close up shots of art in the home shot with camera, feeling is soft and mellow)
close up shots of art, narrated

art is a reflection of time,
time has a certain quality to it, and indescribable essence
it has a way it curves, it has a colour, a story, time has a meaning.
art is a reflection, creation is a reflection
when we create with time, then our lives become a reflection of our work, our art
when we trust in the time that we already have what we need
then we do not work outside of time, attempting to achieve something we already are
