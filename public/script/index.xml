      <description>&lt;p&gt;(shots of people doing things )&#xA;look around you,&#xA;each person is coming from an entirely different world,&#xA;no one of us has ever entered into each others worlds&#xA;we have been in the same world since the moment we came here,&#xA;no one has ever left,&#xA;we we go around pretending&#xA;we are living in the same world&#xA;notice your own world&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;place without rules&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;welcome to the creative sea&#xA;where everything you see&#xA;is an experience&#xA;a product of Einstein&amp;rsquo;s theory of relativity&#xA;everything is an experience relative to it self&#xA;what happens when we turn that fact into our creative reality&#xA;then everything becomes a personal experience&#xA;a perceptive event&#xA;everything is diluted into the senses&#xA;the bodily experience coming from many layers&#xA;coming through our senses, sight, hearing, touch, smell&#xA;coming through our perception of time,&#xA;the past, the future, the now and nothingness,&#xA;each person has been living under the spell&#xA;of their own creative trance&#xA;since the moment they were born&#xA;and since this moment is the only trackable reference&#xA;we have of where this experience began&#xA;and since we can see how everything is a perception,&#xA;we can see the only trackable difference we have&#xA;is the difference in the times we came from&#xA;the only thing that is real,&#xA;is birth and death,&#xA;everything else is made up from us,&#xA;the only thing we have no control over,&#xA;is the time we will die&#xA;and the time we are born&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;the process zine is like a joke&#xA;in that i never know where its going on,&#xA;but it always has a punch line to give me,&#xA;a funny way that makes everything it did before&#xA;make sense&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this project as a metaphor for trusting the creative process,&#xA;I wanted to see what was meant to learn from this process and the project&#xA;because the creative stream I would use to practise documenting and following this thing i trusted so deeply in,&#xA;the process,&#xA;and what happened was a deepening,&#xA;each layer would open me into a vaster understanding,&#xA;I began by eliminating any timeline I had on the project,&#xA;then I had to eliminate the need to share the process,&#xA;then it opened into many streams and sides&#xA;I began breaking down the natural process of creation through the stars&#xA;and creating my own language which taught me I had to&#xA;find another way of understanding this experience&#xA;and then I had to loose the need to understand it and wrap my head around it,&#xA;and now I am playing through multiple streams&#xA;different games on different layers of experiences&#xA;in things we call instagram accounts&#xA;and each one signifies a different layer of my conscious experience&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;the number we see on the screen&#xA;becomes a reflection of self&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;sometimes I think about how people&#xA;will judge my work based&#xA;on how many likes are follows I have,&#xA;when what i&amp;rsquo;ve found is&#xA;the less focus I have on likes and follows,&#xA;the better art gets produced&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;the time we are give&#xA;the birthing of the unknown,&#xA;the understanding we receive from our experience&#xA;the world that becomes itself along the way,&#xA;promising us we are a part of something&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we have supplanted a plan&#xA;in place of unknown potential&#xA;and in the form of a clock,&#xA;trust in an undercurrent,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we pretend that time is a constant speed,&#xA;that it is something we have control of,&#xA;something we can make ours,&#xA;our time is our identity, our memory,&#xA;and tracking it is the way we&#xA;grip hold of this planet as it&#xA;apparently spins out of control&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;the process zine is a tricky game I am playing with myself&#xA;as this world&#xA;it evolves using my reality as a test subject&#xA;to see if the truth of my one great knowing will arrive&#xA;if i use every second as a reason for it to exist,&#xA;if I can find the memory of why i am here in every moment&#xA;I am somewhere&#xA;one layer&#xA;always on the hunt&#xA;to discover how to trust myself more&#xA;how to find another reason that this reality is on my side&#xA;and believe that it has my best intentions&#xA;by believing this I am taken on a journey through every twist and turn&#xA;to bring me at rapid hurdling speed&#xA;towards a destiny that is mine to give&#xA;but it wont let down the performance,&#xA;the act of how to do so,&#xA;for it is not only paving the way,&#xA;it is leaving a trail&#xA;as evidence of creativity using itself to pull&#xA;itself from darkness&#xA;of the great pain and incredible power of how to do your destiny.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;art is time&#xA;(close up shots of art in the home shot with camera, feeling is soft and mellow)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;close up shots of art, narrated&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;art is a reflection of time,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;time has a certain quality to it, and indescribable essence&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;it has a way it curves, it has a colour, a story, time has a meaning.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;art is a reflection, creation is a reflection&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;when we create with time, then our lives become a reflection of our work, our art&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;when we trust in the time that we already have what we need&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;then we do not work outside of time, attempting to achieve something we already are&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
