welcome to the creative sea
where everything you see
is an experience
a product of Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity
everything is an experience relative to it self
what happens when we turn that fact into our creative reality
then everything becomes a personal experience
a perceptive event
everything is diluted into the senses
the bodily experience coming from many layers
coming through our senses, sight, hearing, touch, smell
coming through our perception of time,
the past, the future, the now and nothingness,
each person has been living under the spell
of their own creative trance
since the moment they were born
and since this moment is the only trackable reference
we have of where this experience began
and since we can see how everything is a perception,
we can see the only trackable difference we have
is the difference in the times we came from
the only thing that is real,
is birth and death,
everything else is made up from us,
the only thing we have no control over,
is the time we will die
and the time we are born">

<p>welcome to the creative sea
where everything you see
is an experience
a product of Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity
everything is an experience relative to it self
what happens when we turn that fact into our creative reality
then everything becomes a personal experience
a perceptive event
everything is diluted into the senses
the bodily experience coming from many layers
coming through our senses, sight, hearing, touch, smell
coming through our perception of time,
the past, the future, the now and nothingness,
each person has been living under the spell
of their own creative trance
since the moment they were born
and since this moment is the only trackable reference
we have of where this experience began
and since we can see how everything is a perception,
we can see the only trackable difference we have
is the difference in the times we came from
the only thing that is real,
is birth and death,
everything else is made up from us,
the only thing we have no control over,
is the time we will die
and the time we are born</p>
<p>what am i trying to say</p>
<p>is that time is an energy
and we are a part of this energy
and when we can recognize
I want to live in a world
that has room for big dreams
and when asked this question
I was guided through a process
to see why it was so hard to follow your dreams
and what was stopping us from having the experience</p>
<p>dreams: the ability to follow, trust and live into an inner world as it gradually risings externally. A pathway to discover your own truth. A need to for our future to sync with the rhythms of the planet so that creative forces can expand beyond the perceived density.</p>
<p>As i ventured on this journey
I was meant with one strong factor that was permitting the growth of our &ldquo;destiny&rdquo;
this was the perception of time,
the belief and trust in an external value and number that would define our day,
the belief that the more we defined this number,
and found a way to make the greatest numerical dollars worth of it,
that this was the path to safety and what we wanted on earth
but it is the foundation of this mind set that is trapping the natural flow
that reveals of the internal experience,</p>
<p>an internal experience</p>
<p>we attempt to have an experience that can be defined and explained,
but the thing that wants to come out from inside you
is so much weirder than anything that has ever existed, ever
so it cant be put in boxes or numbers or timelines,
as it unfolds,
it unfolds in layers, from different angles, and it cycles and circles back,
and where you look, its not,
and where it is, it wasn&rsquo;t always,
and what its always,
is never what it seems,
and how it seems,
is never what it is,
and nothing was ever the same as it ever was,
and thats just how it always was.</p>
<p>I must experiment</p>
<p>with the idea that everything
I am going through
has equal value
and it is up to me to find the value
I must experience giving life to nothingness
just to see what value comes back to me
I must paint, to see if the vision I have inside
is powerful enough to come alive
I must die to who I thought I was
to come alive again</p>
<p>without fact</p>
<p>this is a world without fact</p>
