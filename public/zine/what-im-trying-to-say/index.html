We make it seem like how we feel comes from the external experience.
But no matter what experience we&rsquo;re feeling, it remains inside.
We can&rsquo;t create anything in the external world, without creating it first inside of us.
Everything is happening inside of us, not one person living the same world.
and yet the external world does everything it can to attempt find
ways of validating and knowing
ourself from an outer known perspective.</p>
<p>most human things we make in this world are attempting to pull us outside of ourself,
to find a way to make numerical sense and explaining our story to validate its existence.
We are constantly in a process of making sense of our internal world
and we find this validation in the known experiences of the external world.</p>
<p>but we are not designed to know this experience
we experience the same things and have different emotion reactions based on the time
this because our experience time,
and time is experience,
this world is all perception, it&rsquo;s always a reflection to the internal experience of time.
Therefore time is the only real reason behind any of this changing. obviously
Everything else is just another reason we use to valid the same concept,
that everything is always changing.</p>
<p>we cannot know this world and attempt to predict it,
we cannot form our brains around knowing as many facts and perspectives,
so we can be the known answer to as many possible questions,
that people and ourselves have of life
that has designed the best equation,
to collect the greatest amount of known evidence with our time.
We put so much energy into being the answer
to this question
of what life is,</p>
<p>when we say &ldquo;thats life&rdquo;
it is ironically, its like you have been hit with a reality check
like shit man, thats life and life sucks,
but really when we say it,
we say it because its because life hits you from behind,
life comes from an unknown current,
how about instead of being the butt of the joke of life
letting life make a fool of us,
we can become the joke,
see it all ironically, and let life give us the punch line</p>
<p>Either we create things to run from the change, find ways to make the most of it,  or find ways of naming and defining what it is. But no one can ever figure out what it all really is, and no one has ever found any right way to use it, and no one is escaping is, so the only truth we can make sense of in this sea of change, is change. and there is only one way to make sense of change, process. We must become to process, to become to process is to become unknown.</p>
<p>But it is not what we think, it is not something we can define or control, it is something we must recognize we are. And then we can become less prone to needing to control and define to world outside, and we can turn our voice to an internal reality that is emerging. Our sense of time is the foundation of change. The bridge to bring the science and spirit into harmony with earth.</p>
<p>Non Sense making</p>
<p>each moment of the day we are creating ourself deeper into our reality by making more and more sense of it. We put a lot of energy into making sense of it and factualizing the experience. Our minds suck on the numbers and are satisfied by the plans. We always seek to make more and more sense of what we&rsquo;re doing, who we are, an how much we can make of our time before it runs out. Our senses are driven towards all external factors attempting to add up and actualize our relationship with our world.</p>
<p>We lost our ability to tend to the inner crops of sense making, when we were handed a screen that could feed us any world we could imagine, without our need to find and structure the imagination within our mind. It is not the product of our creation, it is the person we create because we made the product. It is the process we undergo to bring something from the imagination into fruition, but when we have lost the need to participate in this process because it is being fed to us through a screen then we end up missing a much bigger piece of life than we can imagine&hellip;.</p>
<p>the screen</p>
<p>we turn to the screen for a known reality. We use technology to make sense and hand us facts. We allow it to feed us the feeling of what we need.We turn to different places when we feel different emotions, we give our emotions the feeling of what our mind think it wants. Our mind is not craving the answer, our mind is craving a pathway, a journey to undergo, a thought process, to allow us to make more sense of our world. When we turn to the screen we are given a linear pathway, directions to follow, a story line where ever scene and character is being used to take us on a journey so we can make more and more sense of what ever we are watching. Therefore our mind has been tuned to make sense of our world in a linear way. We look to our world to tell us a story, believing that if we participate in the right external version then the story will be revealed. But the story does not go this way, the story does not make sense to the characters when they are in it. We are in a different story not the one that makes sense already. The one that we have to participate in and make more sense of everyday.</p>
<p>It is the act of making sense of something, of creating the experience of something that has not yet been made sense of, coming into life, and seeing and experiencing from all sides of your senses. through this process we become what we create, and</p>
<p>Ingesting the multiple layers of your own creation, and allowing them to give credit to the inner world which does not make sense . It is in this practise that we reverse the flow of seeking to validate our experience through making sense of a world that doesn&rsquo;t add up, and begin seeing this place as a place that is not meant to add up, but your journey and experience to find the pieces inside that do, and bring them into existence.</p>
<p>everything in this world is attempting to pull us outside of ourself, and find validation in the known experiences of the external world. we have very little resoruces to make sense of the
we experience the same things and have different emotion reactions because this world is all perception, it&rsquo;s always a reflection to the internal experience of time. Therefore time is the only real reason behind any of this changing. Everything else is just another reason we use to valid the same concept, that everything is always changing.
