<p><em>prescription for dreams</em>
you have seen the goal, reached a target
on the essay of what you want to say.
Now you must become the teacher to yourself
to activate the lessons learned along the way
and continue to teach them to yourself
each lessons deepens as you practise it,
nobody notices
yet you take seriously your ability to learn through yourself
this is the promise
that we are creation learning through ourself
life is a reflection</p>
<p>act on the unknown,
act out of the awareness of your challenges
notice what holds you back, and see past it
remember remember remember
there was no way you had the power to see this goal
without holding the feeling to follow it
you followed it all the way into nothingness
to completely giving up on what it was
and finding it there</p>
