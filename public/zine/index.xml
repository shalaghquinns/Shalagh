      <description>&lt;p&gt;we come from different places,&#xA;we&amp;rsquo;ve created different ways to express these places in words,&#xA;these words are a reflection of the time and space,&#xA;where we will, how we live, what we live with,&#xA;we&amp;rsquo;ve invented similar things in different places,&#xA;and have different words,&#xA;the words are the formula for expression of life,&#xA;the formula we&amp;rsquo;ve created for us to communicate,&#xA;yet even through different languages, the expression&#xA;of communication remains the same,&#xA;when we say different words, we use the same emphasis&#xA;on words when we&amp;rsquo;re angry, or loving, or happy,&#xA;we understand, and know inherently the language of&#xA;expression. Of subtle features,&#xA;micro expressions,&#xA;and art.&#xA;There is a difference between the formula (words) and the expression (communication),&#xA;and both exist and are pervasively intertwined,&#xA;yet the formula express&amp;rsquo;s a definition,&#xA;and the expression doesn&amp;rsquo;t need it, it exists on its own ,&#xA;yet this concept foundational to own we think,&#xA;seeps down into other facets of our experience,&#xA;where we attempt to control and define or&#xA;and formulate how we express ourself.&#xA;Its like we cant separate creativity from our mind,&#xA;we can imagine yet that there is an imagined,&#xA;and imagining reality, happening both at once.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;we cannot pretend to know where someone is coming from&#xA;we cannot pretend that we come from a world that we know&#xA;we are each coming from our own entirely unique world&#xA;and to pretend that we know whats going on&#xA;is to play the game of known reality&#xA;which is not the game of earth&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we did not come to earth to know anything&#xA;we came to explore, to be the thing we always were&#xA;a part of this planet, a piece of a system&#xA;the natural spinning and rising cycles as earth&#xA;we are not on a planet, we are a planet&#xA;and when we remember this,&#xA;we don&amp;rsquo;t form our memory around who we are&#xA;and all the things that came together towards what we see&#xA;we form our reality around what we are experiencing&#xA;in this moment through our senses&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;something simple that requires, dumbing down our brains,&#xA;shutting off the knowing valve,&#xA;and the gathering evidence to formulate a problem,&#xA;towards become a part of the problem, its one slight shift into&#xA;into a world that changes the perspective on every world you move through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point is to change the relationship between the self and their world,&#xA;we are born with a feeling of connectedness and then slowly become separated,&#xA;as humanity pulls us through puberty, the humiliating stage of adopting an identity,&#xA;and we see our world as a place to build our identity,&#xA;everything in the world becomes a product of who we are,&#xA;everything is a personal reflection of our identity in contrast to the world&#xA;we have a comparative lens towards what is us, and what is not.&#xA;we have preferences, schedules, and goals to formulate our identity into existence&#xA;the calendar calculates&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;she got brains and good looks&#xA;so she fell social acceptability&#xA;and got high on surface appearance&#xA;addiction forced her to see&#xA;the deepest parts of herself,&#xA;to make sense of the nonsense&#xA;the journey was carefully crafted&#xA;and the job was hers,&#xA;she suffered for the earth&#xA;to learn to remember&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe we have to give more value to the time unfolding inside of us&#xA;it appears our world has found a numerical system for naming and identifying time&#xA;into money and numbers, and this system in no way gives credit to the&#xA;mystery seeking to unfold from within.&#xA;we must begin the shift in our world&#xA;through the perception of time,&#xA;once we can recognize that we&#xA;are ourself a product of creation,&#xA;their are no facts, and we are a living perception,&#xA;then we can begin to shift our values from&#xA;relying on and cultivating external truth,&#xA;to embodying nonsense.&#xA;We can loosen the need to reinforce plans&#xA;and make sure everything is right,&#xA;when we can see that nothing was right or wrong,&#xA;that it was all happening as a part of the creative process.&#xA;When we can understand this and apply this to our lives&#xA;then our we become less driven towards controlling the external processes,&#xA;and begin to listen to the subtitles of the internal processes which allow us&#xA;to sync with the existing flow rather than&#xA;calculate it and consume it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;we give the external world a lot of credit for how we feel.&#xA;We make it seem like how we feel comes from the external experience.&#xA;But no matter what experience we&amp;rsquo;re feeling, it remains inside.&#xA;We can&amp;rsquo;t create anything in the external world, without creating it first inside of us.&#xA;Everything is happening inside of us, not one person living the same world.&#xA;and yet the external world does everything it can to attempt find&#xA;ways of validating and knowing&#xA;ourself from an outer known perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
