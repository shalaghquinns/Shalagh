the calendar calculates</p>
<p>when we swap this lens,
and turn it inward,
then the experience outside
ripples inwards,
through lens of identity
into the experience of light, of a spectrum,
where everything is seen in its own light,
the inward experience of a forest where everything is connected,
and the experience outside is just a mirror to the same inner world,
just as vast, just as timeless, and unknowable,
yet curious, formative, and expeiencial
the inner sea is connecting itself,
begging to be expressed, made sense of,
given light to something beyond the mask we attempt to wear</p>
