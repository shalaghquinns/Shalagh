      <p>we come from different places,
we&rsquo;ve created different ways to express these places in words,
these words are a reflection of the time and space,
where we will, how we live, what we live with,
we&rsquo;ve invented similar things in different places,
and have different words,
the words are the formula for expression of life,
the formula we&rsquo;ve created for us to communicate,
yet even through different languages, the expression
of communication remains the same,
when we say different words, we use the same emphasis
on words when we&rsquo;re angry, or loving, or happy,
we understand, and know inherently the language of
expression. Of subtle features,
micro expressions,
and art.
There is a difference between the formula (words) and the expression (communication),
and both exist and are pervasively intertwined,
yet the formula express&rsquo;s a definition,
and the expression doesn&rsquo;t need it, it exists on its own ,
yet this concept foundational to own we think,
seeps down into other facets of our experience,
where we attempt to control and define or
and formulate how we express ourself.
Its like we cant separate creativity from our mind,
we can imagine yet that there is an imagined,
and imagining reality, happening both at once.</p>

      <p>we cannot pretend to know where someone is coming from
we cannot pretend that we come from a world that we know
we are each coming from our own entirely unique world
and to pretend that we know whats going on
is to play the game of known reality
which is not the game of earth</p>
<p>we did not come to earth to know anything
we came to explore, to be the thing we always were
a part of this planet, a piece of a system
the natural spinning and rising cycles as earth
we are not on a planet, we are a planet
and when we remember this,
we don&rsquo;t form our memory around who we are
and all the things that came together towards what we see
we form our reality around what we are experiencing
in this moment through our senses</p>

      <p>something simple that requires, dumbing down our brains,
shutting off the knowing valve,
and the gathering evidence to formulate a problem,
towards become a part of the problem, its one slight shift into
into a world that changes the perspective on every world you move through.</p>
<p>The point is to change the relationship between the self and their world,
we are born with a feeling of connectedness and then slowly become separated,
as humanity pulls us through puberty, the humiliating stage of adopting an identity,
and we see our world as a place to build our identity,
everything in the world becomes a product of who we are,
everything is a personal reflection of our identity in contrast to the world
we have a comparative lens towards what is us, and what is not.
we have preferences, schedules, and goals to formulate our identity into existence
the calendar calculates</p>

      <p>I believe we have to give more value to the time unfolding inside of us
it appears our world has found a numerical system for naming and identifying time
into money and numbers, and this system in no way gives credit to the
mystery seeking to unfold from within.
we must begin the shift in our world
through the perception of time,
once we can recognize that we
are ourself a product of creation,
their are no facts, and we are a living perception,
then we can begin to shift our values from
relying on and cultivating external truth,
to embodying nonsense.
We can loosen the need to reinforce plans
and make sure everything is right,
when we can see that nothing was right or wrong,
that it was all happening as a part of the creative process.
When we can understand this and apply this to our lives
then our we become less driven towards controlling the external processes,
and begin to listen to the subtitles of the internal processes which allow us
to sync with the existing flow rather than
calculate it and consume it.</p>

      <p>we give the external world a lot of credit for how we feel.
We make it seem like how we feel comes from the external experience.
But no matter what experience we&rsquo;re feeling, it remains inside.
We can&rsquo;t create anything in the external world, without creating it first inside of us.
Everything is happening inside of us, not one person living the same world.
and yet the external world does everything it can to attempt find
ways of validating and knowing
ourself from an outer known perspective.</p>
