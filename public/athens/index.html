everyone must be protective in their shell against the need to be sold,
in these hotspots, in these places where we have identified as national monument,
where the collective has collective in a swarm around places,
where the number of people grew at the same time as the number of business,
and where you couldn&rsquo;t come around a corner without trying to be sold something
I was in the heart of where western civilization was born
I was in the birth place of this idea,
and it had flipped inward on itself,
the vendors and the people faced an inward tension and anxiety to swim in a current that was over crowded and everyone had to fight for a spot.</p>
<p>I knew somewhere I would find my space.
I would find the perfect balance between world and self,
to create the interaction I needed to thrive.
It wasn&rsquo;t up to me, it was up to them,
I was slowly remembering why i was doing it this way,</p>
<p>It motived me to be someone they met in a fantasy
Someone that would eventually do great things,
they would cross pass with on the streets,</p>
<p>why would I do great things?
because there were great things that needed to be done,
and I could see them</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t take me yet, I have much to say before I am ready,
I promise you shalagh, the plan will be carried out to the tea,
nothing was perfect, it was never meant to be,
everything, and everything and everything was taken care of,</p>
<p>send stuff to ellias,
play the game with the one who sees you,
you are talking to a friend you trust,
you must give it away,
give it away,
give it away.</p>
<p>libra is when we give our self away
again and again, the 2D refection of self comes to peak awareness in Aries.
We come in contact with our shadow, the other and the world explodes.
Once we see that we are the world, we can no longer be a self,
we have to let go of any personality, we have to let go of the reflection,
and all the repercussions that come with being a person.
We can no longer carry this responsibility of knowing who we are, and what our identity is. Its too great of a weight to bring where we are going. When we have come into contact with every side of ourself this leaves our world completely open,
how could we decide from here? When the world becomes up to us, and not the person that we are,
we know that ever choice is up to our becoming, we know inherently, beyond our knowing that we are part of a greater force. We spend much of our day making sense of who we are in the greater sense. Who would we be if we were bigger, what direction makes the most sense for my becoming. We pretend into the feeling of being bigger and better than any self. We sense into the capability.  As vastly as it expands itself, something begins to flip - the more it knows, the more it doesn&rsquo;t know. This gives libra permission to believe in darkness.  The darkness draws us so deep and so wide into our experience that we cant grasp for one second the truth of what is going on. It is up to us to step away from the current, the ride of the world and being a person to find something inside.
This something is a cocktail, a mix of everything that has ever given us life, we must sift through it all to find the diamond, the truth, the alchemy. We feel for it, we wait for it. Everything in life is a hunt for the center, the house of our power. We are so ready to climb the mountain of our full potential but first we must source the equipment for the perfect trek.</p>
