<p>It is as is this thing was a big pie, and it was an evolving pie with many layers rotating under its crust. As you are born you give a tiny little fraction of this pie, and when you are born the slice that you get has a specific flavour based on where the layers were in their rotation. In your life you eat this pie, and slowly digest its layers. You can tell people about the favours of your slice, and they can tell you about the flavours of theirs. But you will not get to try anyones slice but your own, even through flavour are close and we are all from the same pie</p>
