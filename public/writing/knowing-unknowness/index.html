because it is the process of knowing them
where we come alive.
It is the decisions and options that present themselves,
that reveal the known direction.
So when we land at the known,
we can trust that it was the unknown that got us there.</p>
<p>This is the relationship we build,
and the unknown direction becomes more known.
As long as we can always know
that we will know where to go,
then we can exsist with peace here on earth,
in the unknown.</p>
<p>There is no knowness on this journey,
their is however a deepening of truth,
and yet it is never set<br>
only the feeling of fullness inside
aligning with the world around</p>
<p>We are mistaken to think we know
what is known,
because behind of our great knowness,
our carefully crafted shell,
reveals the greatest unknown of all,</p>
<p>it is as if the world we choose not to know,
is the one we already know,
and the world we choose to know,
is the one we really don&rsquo;t,
and that is why we choose it.</p>
<p>We each pick a section of this place to occupy,
a special piece of creation to make from it a home,
and the reason we choose this path,
is because it was the one we didn&rsquo;t know how to do,
but we could hear it calling us anyway,</p>
<p>talents and special abilities arise through the senses
from a great unknown power,
this experience is how we begin to know ourself,
see how we work in the world,</p>
<p>yet the foundation of this of this gift we dont know
where it came from,
we can only guess why.
we were given our gifts to discover why we are,
therefore our greatest gift is the
unknown</p>
<p>the demonization of love</p>
<p>back in the day when they burned witches at the steak
it was the church&rsquo;s way of gaining power,
and squandering all ideas of the existence
of a magical power existing in each one of us,
as the earth was plastered over with its mechanization
it was filled with ways to demonize and make us fear
the unknown. People were terrified to live on earth,
because of what might happen when they die.
Fairytales and stories warned the people that these
were ghosts and witches were there to scare us,
and we became petrified of the unknown.
when this is the only thing happening here.
yet we have covered the earth with every bandage imaginable to attempt to cover and control
this very norma experience.</p>
<p>we want so badly to plan our lives to make sure we are going to be ok, make sure we have money, and a partner, and a place to live. It is only when we go without making sure of this, do we realize it will always be there for us anyway. Each time we imagine not accounting for these big responsibilities, we are lead to imagine to worst possible scenario. The extremes,
but heres the news,
daily life is not extremes,
and when you don&rsquo;t have a plan for it,
each day it has a plan for you.</p>
<p>I have been playing a game,
it started on dec 16 2018,
I realized life was a process
that needed to be trusted in
and each day since I have played this game.
not one day has been planned, and each morning I wake up and wonder what I will want to do.
6 years later I am painting everyday in Nepal,
I am staying for free and getting free food for my work,
I am studying stars and understanding the energies at work in the universe, I am in love with someone who is doing their own thing because I am doing this for myself,
and each day I speak to people about making art,
and trusting the process.
this was the greatest project my life has ever scene,
and has turned each day into a living experiment,
proving and showing me,
under the surface,
that this world is doing
everything in its power,
to support me.</p>
