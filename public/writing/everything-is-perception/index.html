what is the evidence that can prove this.
fact comes from science,
science cannot fathom the existence of both
fact and perception</p>
<p>we are both getting to know
our world,
and getting to know
what it means
truth is both fact and perception</p>
<p>both are based on each other,
never separate
co existing in a dance
to get us to grasp and
sense into our world</p>
<p>we love to search for facts
and for our perception to understand its truth
through facts,
facts create structure</p>
<p>when we let the perception search past the facts
a sense of truth and structure begins to arise
that has its own sense of fact,
infact.</p>
<p>Leaning to trust perception,
craves the path of inner knowing,
and allows us to rely less on external evidence</p>
<p>when we lean to far on the facts
of the known world
the inner perception does very little seeking
to be satisfied.
and when we do search for what we want to perceive,
we turn to scrolling worlds
that satisfy our perceptions desire
without our perception actually having to imagine into it.</p>
