as it creates in one way,
it simultaneously creates for another
in another side of consciousness</p>
<p>we talk about all these states of conciseness,
like we move in and out of them,

the unconscious state is always happening

<p>we are a reflection of time,
when we study a birth chart,
we are looking at</p>
<p>the only truth
everything is a reflection of time
no matter what,
the experience you&rsquo;re having,
is always in relationship to the last moment,
everything, every little experience,
is a response to everything else,</p>
<p>we can have any experience here on earth
that we want to create,
but we cant create anything real,
without moving through every ounce of the time it takes to get anywhere,
this is the only truth.
except death.</p>
<p>we would like to skip over time
get to the fun part,
we forgot how to idolize
the fun part was the making it.</p>
