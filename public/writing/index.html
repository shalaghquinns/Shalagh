you begin listening,
not seriously and kinda curiously

it was the perceived reality

      <p>the conflict is not with the identity it is the way we form our identity. How we can form it together around a main idea. We must central our forces around a main idea within the identity of ourself. There are o many conflicts within conflicts. One side beleives in beleiving in something else outside of itself, the right side wants a leader, it wats someone to tell them what to do.the left side wants themslefs, they want to spread. they cannot unite in the same way as the right. It is not just a conflict between 2 groups of people it is the conflict behnd what we are fighting for. While the left takes up its own path of self identiy, and then forms its belief system around, its journey, passion, hearts path, to choose a cause that benifits the whole. The left will fight for the future. While the right is fighting to maintain, to stay the same, to protect their identity, which is tied into the pattern they have always known. There is no searching for expansion of knowledge, of insight, their is a guard up. They want the land, they want the known, they dont want chaos.</p>

      <p>he said you notice the patterns,
and then you identify with it,
that is not how smart works
i thought thats how i&rsquo;ve learnt to love,
from the insides out,
this is spirituality,
in a world of facts, I don&rsquo;t care how you see it,
the shift is not from the outside in,
you must learn youre youre own,
person,
own experience,
made to unfold,</p>
<p>i see him doing math,
amI jealous I didn&rsquo;t train my brain that way,
or am i grateful i cant work with numbers the same,
i said dror,
I love your brain,
but i really wanna know, does it make you insane.
is playing sane, a part of the pain,
or do you really like thinking that way,
because I lost need,
the ability to see,
how the world adds up logically,
I left it behind, and I cant look back,
because something about being an artist
is so much more interesting.
am i sorry for the way i feel,
dont let me steal the dignity ,
youve collected from thiscollectve frequency,
is it to real for you,
the me i cant not be,
or can you prentend,
and pay this game with me,

I dont want the proff

      <p>i always had a feeling I would have to get over what people thought of me, and I wondered how I would ever get there. I got so good at being great for others, how could I let this image free.
Israel is spitting truth in my face in the most beautiful tragic and mesmoring ways, i am forgetting whats its like to care what other think of me. My old life in Canada feels like a dream I cant remember how it felt to be there. Only the images reply in my mind about the person I tried so hard to be.
I never felt at home in Canada, I felt like an alien. Someone way far removed from its context.
Here in Israel I feel I have met my people again. These people are faced with the deep complex truth of reality, each one of them has to deal with the dark shadows of life in there own way. No one can pretend here. I came from pretend land, where the only problems we must face are domestic. I came from a safe space, I came from protection.</p>

because it is the process of knowing them

It is the decisions and options that present themselves,

So when we land at the known,
we can trust that it was the unknown that got us there.</p>
<p>This is the relationship we build,
and the unknown direction becomes more known.
As long as we can always know
that we will know where to go,
then we can exsist with peace here on earth,

It was created invented a system that would play out all sides of experience,to bring the experience closer to soul. Each individual was a part of the whole coming home, and each one was responsible for addressing sides of the pattern, so that the whole dish can be cooked, and eventually distilled back to its core.It was the journey, the process of this alchemy , we are meant to come and experience. In each life time, following a strand of continuously, constantly weaving and forming like a dna strand. We must respect each-other for their part in the pattern.We must remember for ourself, to remember for those around.We have the opportunity to create tremendous waves through out ability to follow the natural path of creation.To understand what is compromising the system as a part of understanding of self.</p>
