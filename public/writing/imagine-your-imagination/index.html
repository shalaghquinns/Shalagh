when we were young
and could get wrapped up for hours
in our invented mind,</p>
<p>and somewhere along the lines
we had to give over this power
to what was real,
what was proof,
what was good,
what was cool</p>
<p>we lost the ability to
invent this place into our home</p>
<p>creativity is not an art practise
it is not something we make time for
it is never separate from any moment
its always happening
with each moment we make
more and more sense of our world
we are imagining into our reality</p>
<p>the experience is is racked with possibility,
and we are suppose to choose a direction,
we think about it logically,
we add it up in our head,
we come up with a reason based on what we know,
and we form our path forward based on this reason,</p>
<p>we are kidding ourself,
we do not know what we know,
because where ever we go,
what we know expands,</p>
<p>we want to keep track of this knowing,
rationalize it,
in the creation of the rational
we are excluding an experience that begs
to be heard,</p>
<p>nonsense creeps through the sentences
we&rsquo;re explaining to each other,
its haunts our senses as we scroll through our phones
attempting to grasp and integrate all these sides into our world.
we want to stand on top, be the one who knows,
but the situation is bursting at the seems
with the feeling that it doesn&rsquo;t add up
and no one knows what they are doing here,</p>
<p>and this is the truth,
no one on earth,
has any idea
how they ended up here.
thats the only fact.</p>
<p>we think we know what it means
but that would mean we know what we think,
and thoughts aren&rsquo;t for knowing,
and thinking doesn&rsquo;t find meaning,</p>
<p>we like to use our thoughts to add it up,
but it doesn&rsquo;t add up in the way we think</p>
<p>it adds up on other layers,
in other dimensions
and we shant waste
what mental energy we have
attempting to logically
understand this world</p>
<p>this is a ocean
for a creative process
to unfold</p>
<p>it has many streams
underneath</p>
<p>creature degrees
process of
stars</p>
<p>slowly remembering why
creation</p>
<p>sleepy pigeons<br>
imagination</p>

sense making</p>
<p>the first vol
i tried to plan
it taught me it wasn&rsquo;t tied to time</p>
<p>the second vol
i tried to share
it taught me it couldn&rsquo;t be explained</p>
<p>the third vol
i tried to understand
it taught me non-sense</p>
