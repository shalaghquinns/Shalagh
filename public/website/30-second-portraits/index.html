<p>I present people with a question
how do you define 30 seconds.
Im not expecting an answer,
just to asking the question
how do we value art?</p>
<p>Hello Im shalagh</p>
<p>Im an artist from Canada. Ive been traveling the world for years painting and exchanging my art for places to stay. This has been a process of learning to trust the work I have to give has no value that can be defined to numbers.</p>
<p>gage in the process of creation,*
<em>it has a journey it would like to take us on,</em>
<em>a journey we can trust is made for us</em></p>
<p><strong>The Journey of Painting</strong></p>
<p>explore my journey of world of painting the world</p>
<p>for a large part of my 20&rsquo;s I travelled the world painting murals
in exchange for places to say. This is how I learned to trust the people
to support my creation. Each place Ive painted is an extraction of the experience,
and the energy that existed in the space.</p>
