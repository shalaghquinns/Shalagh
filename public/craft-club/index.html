<p>welcome to the creativity club
each week we will explore a different medium of creativity
that has an assignment intergated into your week</p>
<p>the course is to teach us how to live creativity
and extract and find meaning through ourself and our experience.
Its time we devote ourself to a bigger world,
the world inside.
I beielive the future will lose its trust in this outer world,
and we will have no choice but to practise creating our own world.</p>
<p>We will explore how the different mediums extract various sides of inner reflection,
we will learn simple and basic techniques to work with each medium, but will be more focused on the extraction of our inner world, than the final product created. This corse will open many doors in the way you understand you can participate and deepen into a more wild and lively inner experience. The mediums of art are just just the doors I will guide you through, and it is yourself you will discover.</p>
<p>My degree is in interior design, as in the design of inner worlds. I have both a degree from university in the subject and a self proclaimed degree I have given myself in the form of my life purpose. I have taken it upon me to recreate my inner world to shape the experince I want to have in my reality, and I would like to guide others to do the same.</p>
