Every future movement is made from a memory, everything we do comes from the memory of what we have done. When we deepen into the memory, then we can extend in to our future. By altering the way we envision the past we can remember how to be in the present, which is the future unfolding.</p>
<p><strong>the way we die is the way we lived-</strong> our relationship with the unknown meets us much before our time of death. We are called to remember how to fathom the unknown. We can get hooked on timelines when we do not welcome the unknown, and end up reaping time when we die. When we can open in to the unknown in life, we remember how to do this at death, and we can be reborn from the ashes. The time doesn&rsquo;t repeat and instead grows from inside it self, where the everything we learned can be extracted.</p>
<p><strong>time is energy</strong> - when we can understand the properties of time with more depth, then we can understand this depth within our experience. When we can look around and see all the plants moving together at different rates, and different species all interacting within the ecosystem, and all the time in a day playing the grandest role in orchestrating the ecosystem. When we can recognize this is the expression of time, we are able to see all the layers manifesting at once. We can understand that this is also an experience happening within, and we are also an expression of this time. We are lead inwards to the multilayered experience we are having, and we can learn to give credit to these internal time frames over attempting to make sense of our life through a clock.</p>
<p><strong>everything is sense making</strong>- all we do all day every day is make more and more sense of this world. We are called to understand, digest, inhale, exhale, the experience in each moment, slowly and steadying traveling deeper inside your understanding of whats going on around. We make more and more sense of this world everyday in every-way we are pulled outside to make sense of whats going on around us. In this process we have lost the strength, the pull to turn inwards to make sense of our world. We are given externally everything we could have ever dreamed and much more in ur screen pockets at all time. This is such an attractive world, that we have lost attraction to reality.</p>
<p><strong>The cost of screens</strong> - In our endless love affair with technology, we have lost one thing most of all, our reality. The world of screens has so much more to offer us at our fingertips than real life; the grasp is so easy, the grip is so strong. In this process we have lost our ability to imagine more in to real life, maybe its inspired a coupe diy projects and heathly facts and recipes, sure, but the ability to imagine into the possible of the moment is drained. Its to easy to be able to reach for a smart phone and get anything we want.</p>
