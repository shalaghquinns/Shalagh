creativity

we must not only create our worlds but the systems within them. Create systems around how you create.
creativity is nothing but the refection it gives us.
the reflection has become refracted to find external validation
when we relate our creative experience  to numbers, we place a lens on the creativity that blocks the flow.
we attempt t rationalize and know this world, thus preventing the possibility to flow through.
creativity doesn&rsquo;t want a place to go, or an identity, it wants to be, to be scene, to become something, so that it can act out and make sense of whats craving a voice inside.
we must make sense of nonsense,
we are always making sense of our world
