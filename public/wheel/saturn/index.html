Sharp attention to what is meant to move, and whatever is causing a disturbance will be removed uncompromisingly. We are reckoning with defeat from karmic experiences that have devastated a spirit. We are powered beyond our pity with an intense focus on the present. This is the journey where the mental focus is tested, tried and strengthened to move past any doubts of a past swamped in depths.</p>
<p>Taurus: An earthly energy that once has transformed itself, transforms the world around it. Standing in the midst and watching our world become us. Moving with grace from a guidance that views the self as home. The world outside is more complex than our inward situation and we find sanctuary from the contemporary matrix. Within our world we make thorough use of the resources at hand. Coming from a line of karma that has formed a strong pattern and is here taking it one step further. It cannot be expected to change, as we only know how to be true to the self we have always been. </p>
<p>Gemini: Two sides on drastically different versions of self. One side vastly open to the world and all possibilities, this edge keeping us curious and fascinated with an infinite stream of insights that existence keeps sparking. The other is a more grounded and subtle that is aware of all the small obstacles and systems of control that prevent our expansion. It is a world driven by openness and contraction from a karmic condition has dealt with feeling an of obstruction of life force from lives where we&rsquo;ve expanded have been unable to live up to our full potential. Integrating an internal strife and tendency for extremism, through meeting extremes we seeing a greater context that weaves the path towards a wider horizon.</p>
<p>Cancer: Learning how to integrate into every situation of life and becoming supremely adept at handling our self within the context of everyone else. Carving space for full embodiment of  others, but in doing so we blur the difference between our own responsibility and the problems that arise, in turn becoming a vessel for all that is wrong. When the karmic journey has become one with the known and is closely bound in it experience, a space in-between opens to reveal when we step away from taking on collective responsibly personally - we can use our large perspective in each situation without getting wrapped up in it.</p>
<p>Leo: A strong and noble force of life purpose. Our path is to respect and follow individuality which never leaves our sight as we meet ourself again and again sticking to the intentions set. Continually seeking to discover this commitment in others and is not met with the same dedication. One with our truth, but must learn to leave the space for others who are less self assured. The karma at work has done all the steps towards fulfilling individuality, and is ready to give over our self importance. Once we have found our place we can step through the veil of individuality into being one with the heart of the world. </p>
<p>Virgo: Steady on task with the matter we&rsquo;ve created in our sphere of life. Attempting to structure ourself around the subtle forces of the intent at hand by creating blinders from the rest of the world. Many hurdles on the path towards wholeness. We take all facets and experiences, digest them through our lens, and slowly begin opening the doors for the rest of the world through a process that is entirely character building. The goal is to finally take the leap, jumping into the moment of where it&rsquo;s at and meet life in a way to perpetuates the wave. Something that at first seemed impossible becomes easier with time, and finally allows the self formed path to become one with the process of where it&rsquo;s at. </p>
<p>Libra: Awareness at the core that the surface path is likely to be misleading, and coming out of a hazy grasp towards fully embodying our personal journey. Tempted and pulled towards the socially acceptable, seductively appropriate path, but being weighed heavy with feelings of self betrayal. Our journey is one of  self recreation, with a full blooded determination to fill the shoes of our imagination. A karma that had once lost its self belief, is continually asked to make the harder choice and take higher road to find we are able to continually meet ourself as the earth at the edge of its evolution.</p>
<p>Scorpio: We are moving into the depths of every experience in order to break through a well of karma that has been living in a less than fully embodied state. We are learning to rise up, by moving through the lowest patterns, seeing them for their truth, and fiercely moving forward. We meet ourself in the flames of destruction. The persistence to transform is vital as each hurdle presents another. Anyone else would be tremendously hindered by this path, but it is what invigorates us. We are pleased to take up the path of self overcoming. </p>
<p>Sag: Taking all our scattered bits and pieces and molding them together into great structure and  master plan. A wildness we are learning to tame, and in the friction of working against ourself we are driven forward towards remarkable leaps of embodiment. Our nature is volatile and persistent, and we are here to over come it. Letting ourself down just to build back up. This karma seeks to view life from an entirely different perspective, coming from feeling we have not met the standards, the search is for an entirely new angle and we are learning how to work with our fresh insights.</p>
<p>Capricorn: We know ourself and have a clear intention for the steps needed to take. The path to becoming will be met with bizarre events and experiences that deny what we knows inside to be true. This karma has gone to great heights and depths, and has a finely tuned awareness to mobilize tremendous forms of human attainment. Designed to stay grounded and in touch with our perspective while integrating contradicting experiences. We must reOtherwise swept into tireless tasks swamped by a dark and grim stark awareness.</p>
<p>Aquarius: The path is marked out ahead and we are finely tuning our skills towards embodiment of what is truly needed for the whole. Our biggest hurdle will be learning not to pragmatically attempt to plan and execute our own perfect functioning and instead become a vessel for the objective truth to represent the cause consistently. Karmically coming from extensive training and skill building, now translating to an inner knowing of what is the direction forward from here. </p>
<p>Pisces: Using the energy of the collective to come into ourself. Meeting the depths of human experience and using its emotional effect on us to create our world. Feeling a hidden current in our form and learning to embrace the stream from others that moves us internally. Connected to the mystery, living in between, and not distracted by what the conditioned mind considers important. Our  task is too discover the language speaking to us and to subtly merge it into our own inner world. We are learning how to apply this experience as we&rsquo;ve come from a karma where these depths had not been touched, and we were swamped by civilization. </p>
<p>Saturn houses </p>
<ol>
<li>Coming into each sequence of life in full embodiment of our own pace. A willing engagement and full participation to move into what is next. Haunted subtly by the ghosts of the past and ingrained patterns, which motivate is sharply and sometimes ruthlessly to take up each new venture in the discovery of fresh territory. Karmically overcoming old memories to form an entirely new path of creating self into being.</li>
<li>Knowing ourself and sure of what we must do. Finding the way to integrate the work we came to do by opening to spontaneity. Karmically coming from a place with developed gifts and abilities, but had lacked the framework to implement them on earth. Uncovering this task through remaining open to all side without preference and practising flexibility. Clearing mental irritability and internal projections to fully embody our journey, free of the way it should be, and into presence.</li>
<li>Encountering something similar in every direction, and coming up against all the patterns and temptations that we&rsquo;ve fallen for. From all the fragments births a regenerative power that can hold steady under the sway of the drama, impulses and reactions. Karmically having reinforced regressive patterns, our now initial desire goes against what we know we needs. A continuous journey to see beyond the engrained assumptions into a vibrant discovery of the unseen .</li>
<li>Standing in the midst of a dense chronic condition, petrified, and designed to endure the search for core truth among delusion. Building strength to see through a fragmented world and find total inner resolve. Taking the long road, and drawing towards fears to redeem a karma of self suffering. Resiliency created by continuously digging deeper through doubt and denial to eventually carve the space to fully embody our truth fully and unite with the core of the earth.</li>
<li>Coming into the world through our self, and unable to play into any surface appearances and egoic fantasys. We must move form origin, as we promised ourself to be sure to undertake the deepest path of selfhood unfolding. A karma with tremendous lessons in self discovery is here to take the journey in full. The backside is coming to terms with others less formed identities, as our own truth can never radiate fully if it is rooted in self righteousness. We must forgive and surrender our lesser self to come into communion with the regenerative powers of our species.</li>
<li>On track and forming ourself around this track. Particularly in tune with the requirements needed to carve a path forward. What is absent is personal expression, which is supplanted with the functional skills of what we came here to do. Under the surface is a karmic promise to serve which contain hidden forces and move us towards direct and straightforward impulses that channel what is vitally needed. By giving energy to the bigger picture, the soul is given space to rest and recuperate, each day fashioning ourself further into a form living light. </li>
<li>The self meets the earth through the other, and wonders through them what we are. Yearning to expose all the angles of our expression with the craving of full acceptance. Karma contains tremendous achievement and failure, and we spend much time living in the drama of either situation, rarely glimpsing the full spectrum of his own being. Attempting perfect execution, yet unconsciously guided to see between all definitions towards an open density, once we have let go of the need to be appropriate. </li>
<li>Becoming something we have never seen before. Ensuring to make the most of each moment by tuning into the whole spectrum of human experience and drawing out unseen worlds. Seeking the next dimensional relationship between self and world. The karma of searching for life&rsquo;s remarkable external experiences has lead to neglect internal life. Space away from external stimuli allows forces behind the scenes to renew and spark a lifestream that doesn&rsquo;t over extend itself, but stays deeply inwardly in-tune with life&rsquo;s infinite unfolding beauty. </li>
<li>Understanding we have a density and are awakening to a great truth. The language of spirit is internally formed. Our karma has come to an internal reckoning of life from all angles, good evil, truth and false hood, and is here to know ourself fully as we is. Any amount of blind distortion from the lesser self is amplified to form a great lesson. The self meets itself at trial, where we must pull past layers of scepticism and worthlessness, towards the the awakening of our great internal truth.</li>
<li>Beyond the known, living in the streams of a truth yet to be. Aligned with the bigger picture of the collective need. A pure vessel for greater truths to come through. Flipped inside out and not held down by fact or personal limitation. Personal karma has been suspended to make room for the greater truth and we are learning to put ourself aside, or else we feel the burden of unworthiness. Gathering internal strength to become a vessel to meet the time with what is really needed for all.</li>
<li>An open door moving onward and with a perception stretching to infinity. Open to messages from beyond and hard experience to communicate. We are often diluted to the one who advocates for what&rsquo;s more than meets the eye. A karma highly involved in the collective experience is now emerging with an awareness beyond time. The journey towards uniting all sides of consciousness to grasp the ultimate destiny, and moving them towards the horizon without doubt.</li>
<li>Profoundly introspective, helping the collective move inwards. Able to navigate lifetimes of memories and future visions without preference or attachment. Timelessly dreaming. There are no boundaries of time and we feel disconnected from the pace of society, being deeply aware of its nothingness. Standing apart from self we dwells in the space of whats driving nature and karmic forces. Forming in our soul what is not yet known on earth. A place of inward travel, with the need for external manifestation.</li>
