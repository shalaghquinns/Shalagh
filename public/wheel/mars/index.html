    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Aries: Aware of our concerns and directing them forward to widen the space. Learning to integrate the concerns of the world with the concerns of self. When tuned in he can use this energy to widen the social sphere for everyone, but when he feels like his ideas are not respected by the world, he turns to dominance and aggression. Here it is clear he is his own worst enemy, and is learning to respect his own ideas. He doesn&rsquo;t need approval to be himself, but he does need to approve himself, to be approved by others. </p>
<p>Taurus: Personal will at its strongest, remains on steady course and in touch with course at hand. Low focused ground earthy physical awareness that is not distracted by the outer world. A channel towards a greater path of embodiment, however when strayed from his truth, he becomes stuck on blind truths that have no grounding in reality. </p>
<p>Gemini: He is in discovery of his truth and his world is a wide net with the ability to stretch in all directions. Embracing possibility at each junction. Oftentimes the world cannot feed  him the energy required, so he creates fantasies or tangents of reflections to keep it alive. Everything is either a dream or reality, he is all of it or none of it. Requiring embodiment of the vision. </p>
<p>Cancer: He is fine tuning his energy expression to give what is most needed, no more or less. He understands his world from many angles and takes action based on where his heart is at. Can sense into the future and how he will be perceived so he is conserving energy for its optimal use. Gifted to tune into the complex matrix of existence and determine what is needed. If trapped in everybody&rsquo;s else&rsquo;s needs he becomes immobilized. </p>
<p>Leo: He is on a path of self embodiment that people make way for and no one can deny. He can bring forward his gifts to inspire, regenerate and strengthen the collective. He is closely guided, right mode, breeding right action. If he betrays the hearts cause at  the will of his own programming and self worship, the downfall will be self destructive, leaving him blindly achieving destiny alone. </p>
<p>Virgo: He is geared to balance and make whole life for everyone. This places him in the center of unfolding events with a physical participation of the most grounded approach, where everything is accounted for and nothing can go wrong. Energy moves as a series of tasks, and multitude of skills, applied with precision and when to a specific direction, reaches perfection. When off task he is overwhelmed by nagging voices and chaotic information. He is channelling these voices and many selves into a supremely fine tuned upbuilding force. </p>
<p>Libra: He is finely crafting his expression for maximum extraction of interactions. Can sense into the emotional atmosphere and is able to instinctively devise an expression that will weave the situation closer. He is available to meet each moment candidly, while carrying a plan and direction forward. This is where the world of the self has learned to optimize external resources to create an expansive dance of self embodiment drawing out expression from others. If instead used for controlling others, manipulation, he becomes a reverse image of what was meant and embodies his shadow. </p>
<p>Scorpio: Passionately absorbed in everything, carries a lens of dispassion to prevent full absorption. He is in the process of accessing a full stream of liberation life force and can sense it around the corner. This drives him mad with the need to break through and the seemingly impossible ways to do so. A point in the journey where the stream for self liberation and excess of creative energies lives in breaking the boundaries at the core of the matter - which if not pushed through can feel as though existence is impenetrable and poisoned by denial. </p>
<p>Sag: A spirit of high self conviction and a genius multi dimensional fluidity.  He is adept at navigating all the waves, curves, and currents with resilience, and will whip out whatever talent is needed to get him involved with what is unfolding. Delighting to fill the room with his personal finesse, tremendous charm and enthusiasm. When he takes the image of himself as invincible, his imagination can draw him into the abyss about who he, a story that will be true, but will be one of blind self worship, captivated by his own self enchantment. This is the placement for getting the point across, and exploring it again and again, which can be a beautifully fulfilling lens to open to spontaneous experience, or if solidified can become a story needing to constantly reinforce about the way he wants to see himself. </p>
<p>Capricorn: The inward purpose being fine tuned for its immediate expression. Accommodating the inward perspective to gather awareness for its outward physical release. He is the unswayed, unapologetic embodiment of a godlike expression. If he gets swept away in the egoic image of the great me, then his influence will end up diminishing those under it. If he chooses to serve the great one, the energy will provide great development in others. It only takes one man to make or break this show. </p>
<p>Aquarius: He is intellectually seeking to formulate solutions that bring down to earth, systems that serve the common good, and his dedication is steady. He is able to view his progress without self involvement, allowing him to become an expression for true time and nature. If he lets the patterns of the mind saturate this vision he will use cleverness and sophistication to reinforce all systematic earth bound intelligence, and cloud all natural human intelligence. He is a crystalline beam with incredible capability, or one buys into the mechanized, perfected, character of flawless functioning for all. </p>
<p>Pisces: He is driven through all the darkest depths to build momentum to overcome himself. This is where expression unfolds when we mobilize inner forces to recover the missing pieces, we are blessed with courage and perseverance to champion the unpopular cause and uncover the past depths to integrate and sweep the field clear of special interests which inhibit our evolution. He can be swept above to the currents that unites humanity, or swept away to the darkness of a world of lost dreams. </p>
<p>Houses</p>
<p>1st: He is himself and is committed to what immediately feels right. Emphasis on his own self assertion, and sphere of interest tends to negate the perspectives of others, giving them much less emphasis than he does himself. He is learning patience, tolerance, and intergration of  others, which opens infinite doors by holding the same space for assertion and expression he allows himself. As he makes room for the other, it often contradicts his own assertion and he comes to own a full bodied response that creates an interaction that is lively, engaging and truly genuine. </p>
<p>2nd: He is learning what he stands for and must uncover the truth in all of it by always activating multiple levels of awareness. Fine tuning this primal drive means stepping over the line, and back again time and again. Pushing yourself to either defend our position, or backing off completely. We learn to respect our primal drive by grasping a deeper understanding of the process unfolding over time, revealing many layers. Learning from our mistakes, and seeing life itself as valid, rather than one that needs resolve. </p>
<p>3rd: Sharply seeing and participating with the moment, he is instantaneously alive to make the most for everyone. If this initial spark should fly he is off, if not he waits and dwells, seeing it as a time in between time, waiting for the next spark. He is learning to take that time and find what is available in the unseen. Once he can see between the lines he can move candidly with his world without preference, discovering stimulus and value in the journeys without surface appeal. Learning that life cannot be planned or designed towards gratifying moments. </p>
<p>4th: He is taking on and through him all the doubts, fears that anguish the edges of existence. His drive is to fix the problem, and in doing so takes on the weight and responsibility of it all. His goal is to undercut the initial voices, take instinctual responsibility, and see that the problem can be released and he is not its vessel. This placement can be trusted that it is the final stage towards moving through this pain, and when it can, will be fully taken care of by spirit forces. </p>
<p>5th: He is recognizing he is becoming who he was meant to be and the dance of purpose leads a light in a world where the primal self sleeps. He doesnt fit the mold, and moves forward without looking back towards his own individual deeply rooted creative expression, and tuning it in a way to make it readily available without inhibition. </p>
<p>6th: He is a stream of specialized abilities requiring an outlet from feeling physically trapped. He is so aware of the shortcomings of the scenario and seeks to bring his gifts forward to heal this scenario. This will take some time for the inner and outer worlds to merge, but when they do, this energy finds a path where it can be comfortable and function beautifully. </p>
<p>7th : He is open to a world of possibilities at every juncture to keep him plenty busy and engaged with his world. He is learning how to serve this energetic spontaneity, by stepping outside of himself and opening the doors to his beautiful primal expression. To meet the world and discover it endlessly as he desires, he must see he is the earth, not a self on the earth. In this way he does not see himself as something that is served by the earth, but rather an embodiment of it, that allows the primal energy to express itself openly and receive openly. </p>
<p>8th: He is tuned into his own destiny, truth, and deep understanding, and is obsessed with cultivating an inner stream that draws the depths of each scenario. He seeks so vividly to pull out and make the most of each scenario, it takes some tuning before this energy learns to grow with the situation, rather than attempt to birth it fully. His energy carries a depth that he puts value in, and in turn others do as well, he must step aside the mirror of what they see in him, and can access a stream that is no longer clung to self and can become one with human nature and the surging power of its being. This can open up the same limitless power in others. </p>
<p>12th: He is going to the depths to tackle the impossible, becoming fearless. A tremendous power to move through hurdles with more power, where others would have strayed far. The energy forces the being to see through the assumptions, the collective denial, and digging for truth as he is energized by this destructive creative rebirth. Held back, to be pushed forward, each step deeper, no final reasoning, or logical reason to settling for less than being fully available to the greatest depths of the process which call us to take the punch and come back again.**</p>
