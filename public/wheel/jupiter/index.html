A dualistic perspective, charged and determined to come out on top being right. The internal drama is hot, and he plays out his reason why hard. As much as he reveals as the good guy, will be as much as is obstructed to reveal a contradicting perspective. Learning not to let the dialect consume him to leave space to see in between the lines.</p>
<p>Taurus: Consciousness is in an intimate creative conversation with the senses. A vessel to comprehend life&rsquo;s natural processes which speak to him quietly. Deep earthly awareness moving through itself, yet estranged by conflict of what is out of his sphere. Works to remove himself from confusion and external drama by staying creativity engaged with his own spear of sensibility.</p>
<p>Gemini: Ideas and conscious experience cast a large net lite up to encompass a multi dimensional universe. Glowing in response to possibly, open to perceiving the multiple ways of seeing. Learning to keep a fluent open grasp to digest all sides. Imagination is key to staying present here or else becoming trapped in a chaotic catastrophe of desires and self imposed boundaries from an over-stimulated mentality, without a focused path. </p>
<p>Cancer: In touch with the heart of the matter. Piercing through the many sides towards a perspective beyond impressions. Seeing through to the bigger picture and common goal to become a focused point of wisdom and channel for the truth to emerge. Can not be expected to stray into opinions of multiple sides and instead remains a steady beacon of focus in a scattered world. Where truth intelligence meets the body, and the gravity of the heart meets the reality of the situation.</p>
<p>Leo:  Personal truth meets itself in the world. Sensing the selfs way of seeing as central and pivotal, and exercising its purpose with each stride. Gifting the world with a well presented and graciously curated enlarging and empowering viewpoint that is able to take up each stage of becoming with fully embodied strength.  The energy comes from the heart and maintains a strong foundational truth and central pillar of reference for coming to self hood for all.</p>
<p>Virgo: The point of the journey when personal truth becomes aware of its impact on the earth. Either on point and channelling what is needed or feeling at odds with multiple perspectives and a  fragmented execution. Many sides and voices to consider, so one must loosen its pragmatic grip and engage with constructive steps forward or else becoming helplessly trapped in a sea of contradictions. Tapping the goodness of life to find a focused intelligence that provides an abundant path forward.</p>
<p>Libra : Mental analysis enraptures the individual, leading to the pulls of what&rsquo;s right and wrong. Feelings are racked with uncertainty but yield significant results when held with faith. Reactions must be freed of social standards and preconceived versions to sense into the present moment so innate inner truth can be heard. Learning to move freely with the waves of the scenario, into the cracks of the irrational and speak directly from what arrises in the moment. </p>
<p>Scorpio: Ego is shedding to awaken the power of an unknown voice. Planetary forces intervening to dissolve self contained worlds. Unable to waste time identifying with personal notions and fixed identities. Feeling swamped by delusions and external disguises, yet a truth beyond truth persists to take up an unpredictable journey that pierces through all falsehood into the core of ones being. Discovering a sea of infinity within the unknown behind being any one at all.
 
Sagittarius: Budding with the new potential, yet subconsciously aware of all the forces that cause it to go wrong. The subconscious fears stay ready and grounded, and allow the consciousness to run wild and free with its biggest dreams. Once one can begin to reckon with the part that assumes that something is innately going to go wrong, by acknowledging that the first leap is never going to be initially supported as it is a vision a head of its time, they can open more freely to allow new potential to flow through.</p>
<p>Capricorn : The final flushing out of the egos control of the mind. Inner knowing is strong, and anything unknown strengthens this knowing to prove itself further. This frictional conversation, slowly gives way to a deeper understanding that looses the mind control, opening our highest potential for embodied truth. Learning  to believe that we are here for the collective enables us to merge our self with the needs of the earth. Or else we risk becoming a vessel for power control and manipulation. </p>
<p>Aquarius: Inner knowing&rsquo;s aware of the path to take as it is thematic woven through life. Directed towards social responsibility and facing all the factors that permit its growth with deep disappointment. The mission takes up each moment by attempting to fix the problems head on. In this process the needs of the collective are becoming woven into the conscious experience creating a focused presence attuned to stitching resourceful solutions. A slowly grounded universal awareness grants the ability to sense each scenario as a dream much vaster than the memory of its failure.</p>
<p>Pisces: Where all the dreams and yearnings surface into high gear and a thin veil for exchange keeps the whimsical side alive and receptive to possibility. In deep contact with the subconscious forces and unconscious memories that make it hard to find a footing. Submerged in the flashes and finding comfort in the dreams, which carry an other worldly familiarity and see reality from an observe stance. Finding oneself where they are not looking, and seeking oneself in what can&rsquo;t be seen. The embodiment of a paradox fuelled by the space between self and not self, where as soon as the self gives up, it discovers what it seeks.</p>
<p>Jupiter </p>
<p>Where the feeling meets the intellect and the consciousness expands. As jupiter move through the houses it brings awareness to one side, and indoing so subconsciously integrates the next. (senses integrate throught process in body, thought process integrates multiple truths, multiple truths integrates deeper truth, deeper truth integrates higher expression, higher expression integrates, earthy truth, earthly truth integrates early forces, earthfocres uncover new truth, new turht uncover voice, voice uncovers embodiment, embodiment uncovered multiple truth, multiple truths uncover dreams, and dreams uncover senses) </p>
<p>Jup Houses</p>
<ol>
<li>Receiving the world through the senses, and feeling as though what arises was designed and made for us. Our external awareness is captivating  and so vibrantly open that the pull to move inwards is dim. Once an internal gift is recognized we can create ample space to grow inwardly and receive the senses needed to participate in the vision forward. Lack of internal recognition creates the appearance of a chaotic world lacking foundation. <em>Senses move inward to learn to grow from the inside out.</em> </li>
<li>Two worlds work in tandem, one side rationalizing and integrates, while the other probes and stays open. The rational side is often more dominant, while a quieter awareness is listening to understand the hidden motive of whats brewing under the surface. While one side wants to see growth and steady structure, the other is learning to be open to worlds yet to be. Both voices must be integrated by giving each side the space to grow and open on its own for its unique contributing value. <em>Igniting presence in 2 worlds of the body._</em></li>
<li>Internal awareness is open to its own unfolding process and the discovery of multiple streams of insights. Helplessly flooded by stimuli, and learning not to identify with set forms as it rides the waves of revelations by closely listening to the internal experience at each junction. Feeling drawn between experiencing chaos and controlling a restricted path. We must fashion our being from all the experiences and seemingly wrong turns, to recognize our durability and surrender to our adaptability so we can continue seeking and know we are still truly ourself. <em>The realization is that no truth is greater than the other, and all moments are equally as revealing.</em></li>
<li>Trapped in a deep hole of mental conspiracy that has no direction out. Our vessel is open to swallow the deep truths and lets the shadow consume us. There is no making logical sense of this condition, and we become deeply entrapped by our own memory. The way out is under, to recognize and take seriously the ways the world has outwitted and taken us over to activate beneath our assumptions so a power within can rise that no rational reasoning can hold us down any longer. <em>Awakening to all the depths underneath comprehension,</em> </li>
<li>Each step is propelled by personal truth the embodiment of our mission. We can help others do the same, but are primarily fiercely concentrated on remaining on the mark of our own personal beliefs because of a deep awareness that the world attempts to strip us from this. Finding the fire of individuality which has a flame so powerful, and strong that any other way of knowing will not meet its standards. That knowing of self which is so on fire inside that it can not truly be impressed upon by the exterior world. <em>Building up internal way of knowing.</em> <em>Getting rid of rational</em> </li>
<li>Devoting one self to the needs of the group, believing there is no greater purpose than functioning and forming oneself to meet the needs of what is required. Such enthusiasm to embody this perfected way of functioning; but is always subtly haunted by the inner knowing that this focus is denying him from experiencing much of his world. Scenarios will pop up as hints and keys that point to a part of ourselves we forgot to integrate. When the inner knowing learns to take responsibility for its own feeling it can meet the needs of the earth . <em>Integrating knowing will with early forces.</em></li>
<li>Meeting the world to set a blaze on the other, expanding on their capacity. Often met with the disappointment that the other does not fulfill this same ability in us, as we do in them. Many relationships perception are built on how these experiences have affected him and can create a dissociative shell. When we recognize others will never be able to see the same possibly as us we can begin to devote ourselves more of the moment and becoming a vessel for mixing ingredients to create something new. We are merging our vision with the earth and in doing so those close to us may grow further away but closer to the whole. <em>Merging consciousness with earth</em></li>
<li>The moment of truth surfacing. Granted a view from the edge of existence with a startling awareness and a stroke of clarity into the cracks in between.  Sensing the thin bridge that connects dreams and reality and able to take this as far as we choose. If we follow our depth we will be lead to the edge of every scenario, knowing exactly what to do with the moment and how far to take it. Even without engaging our potential we remain in a spectacular reality within the confines of a normal existence, having deep appreciation for it all. How ever far we are willing to take our experience will match our awareness, for as deep as it goes and much is mutually fertilized. The depth will prevail as the more intriguing perspective either way. <em>Consciousness growthing through the earth.</em> </li>
<li>At the forefront of our awareness is the path to align with a higher initiative. Sensing we are being shown the way, and eager to be an active participate in our unfolding pattern. A lucky star to follow and be a vessel for great truth, or becoming defined by conventional success.  There is  a choice between achieving reputation and status or aligning with earthly forces to work for something bigger than ourself. Moving beyond the ego and any engrained mannerisms, to embody an inward vision as the light for all. Must come to reckon with the delusions of success and the ways that it severs reception from spirit. Following the inward light in manifesting good for all involved and becoming a living example of someone who followed the heart&rsquo;s centre because of the strength of its pull.</li>
<li>A wide grasp on the whole with a distilled grasp on the problem so all can comprehend. The sights are on the truth of the wide scoop of the matter. We are the conduit to transmit the information needed to support the cause, and can strip it down to a systematic way of explaining it. Bring forth the gifts of others is our gift and out motive to transmit this universal grasp to help increase their perspective.  The complete giving over of consciousness to the greater cause and having the opportunity to channel universal applications is most fulfilling. A vast grasp on the net, and open cord to strike the note of truth that applies to the whole world. <em>Universal understanding is diluted for the whole to consciously grasp.</em></li>
<li>Aware before it happens and learning to believe in and venture out to the places that have not been seen. Cultivating faith and patience, while holding steady for these changes find rhythm and dance. A foot in the mud of a rushing river while the water waits to settle. In tune and aware of the significance of our mission, and able to play out other roles in the surface meantime. Trying on roles becomes a dance to experiment with the vibrations of collective currency. Our disguises are well hidden and provide freedom of movement from a deep place inside where the self has a grasp on the true vastness that a vision requires to ignite change on this earth.  </li>
<li>Inside the world and diving deep into every experience. Worlds that don&rsquo;t make sense seek to be comprehended here. Brewing a space to witness the truths that are hard to grasp, doing it unconsciously. Must pull behind the fears, and will come out with a greater lesson each time. In the process of weaving dreams and imagination through these deep inward places we find each time we are brought a fresh canvas or new departure point. When we can strengthen our draw towards these departure points over the darkness we become a wealth spring of fresh perspectives for all to nourish from. </li>
</ol>
<p> The direction is channeled and creates a strong foundation for integrity, to allow simple truths to unfold.</p>
