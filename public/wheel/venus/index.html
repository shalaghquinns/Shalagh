    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Aries: We sees ourself in the world and seek to discover who we are though the other. Constantly discovering the feeling the other creates in our own heart. The playground of relationships continues to expand as long as the other can stand its ground and give her the space to dance around, if the other is just recitable as she, she will recognize her loneliness. That she is seeking a piece of herself in the other. She will join into a relationship with herself, to discover the missing piece she was seeking in the other. </p>
<p>Taurus: She is the way she senses the earth and participates in her senses. Unconsciously she is shutting out much of what complicates this reality and consciously forming a base around what she values, has created and worked for. Deep embodied appreciation for the process, and removed from many airy concerns. She is a rock for others and in silence brews depth and substance, The self is what is valued, and is a magnet for value. </p>
<p>Gemini: She is in a relationship with infinity and sees infinite capabilities with no boundaries - this sense lies out in front of her as she flys freely towards. The search is a total view point to expand limitlessly. This takes time to embody fully and she is learning to grant herself permission by taking small steps through the embodiment of these many enthusiastic sides. She meets all spectrums of experiences because she is open to them. Her sympathy is universal but her self awareness is lacking. She is unattached as she is moving beyond herself, and is unaware of how far out she has traveled. Stretching the hearts center out into the earth. </p>
<p>Cancer: She is coming from the contact with the collective need and is integrating it into the personal sphere of life. She is closely in touch to her depths of her inner longing and deepest yearning, and is learning to integrate this inner awareness into the surrounding world. She will often remain far from touching her external world fully, and will deepen inside until she has created a place that she can grow from. Becoming an influential figure which has absorbed the collective consciousness and transmitted it through the heart. She will continue to contact the collective with the memories that contain hidden messages of the anguish yearning to be lived out. </p>
<p>Leo: She is coming from an identification with the all, learning to follow her own beat. She has angelic forces guiding her with steady tread. At first the net is widely cast to identify with the whole and be one with everyone - which allows the individuality to form over time. When she can learn to embody the parts that aren&rsquo;t conventional she turns her attention inwards towards her own light. She knows she is mirror for others to see themself, and must return to its owners all the reflections she has played into to bring this light out in others. Coming to realize that playing these parts was alway practice for the embodiment of her higher self, one with many side. </p>
<p>Virgo: She takes up her many sides with the actions to pursue and fulfill life on earth. She has divided the world into the sphere that is these interests and the sphere which is not, and puts much energy into maintaining her sphere and world view will prevail. She is finetuning her gifts and knows that in order to maintain and fertilize this structure it must be with subtle strategy and and minutely intune with the ever shifting position. Close watch on the matter she has decided upon early at hand. Since her values are sensible towards maintaining this path, she insists she must do what she does, and works to maintain each step believing the bigger picture will take care of itself. Full expression will not be embodied until the emptiness is swallowed. </p>
<p>Libra: Freely willable able to open to meet love in the presence moment unconditionally. She can spark the fire of life, heightening the attractiveness of all scenarios, and will take this as far as she can flow with this dance. However, because of the magic attraction of this aura, she can easily become the embodiment of everyone&rsquo;s favorite version of life, becoming enraptured in the drama and external appearance of transformation rather than the actual inward journey. She must see through the appeal to be wanted and seen, to take up the full spectrum of life participation. Breaking the mirror of appearances. </p>
<p>Scorpio She is the process itself moving through itself, and she is the only vessel that can fill her. This is the sense of making sense through themselves. She dives into the irrational and is pulled by emotional logic over all forms of rational. She must take the deepest emotional way, and take the densest root to get there. In times where this becomes self destructive she will turn to starve herself from some time from emotions in order revive herself from deep down inside. All her energy is going towards completely overcoming herself, and this pressure will push her to the with the intensity of the one with the guts to take it all the way, </p>
<p>Sag </p>
<p>She is acutely in tune with the potential of the moment, opening streams, and embodying all sides of the spectrum which are seeking release. Special ability to make room for and allow things to unfold. Because she has such a draw to let these energies unfold, she is equally drawn back when they do not continue with their initial stride. Her world is constantly seeking, until it discovers this approach is less than. Sustainable to sustained growth. Will she turn this perspective inwards, to a wiser view that is able to extract the vibrancy from all forms of existence. </p>
<p>Capricorn </p>
<p>She is closely observing herself to make sure her gift and execution is finely tuned. She is learning to express this truth and through externalization, she will inevitably discover all the ways this externalization stems from all the places she feels she is lacking. A side of ourselves has to over compensate, to blind the part we hide from. This is the process of integrating truth and falsehood towards full embodiment. Beggining to see the truth is in the process, that none of it has any hierarchy, both sides are vital. </p>
<p>Aquarius </p>
<p>She is in tune with her expression, and heads straight in the direction of this I inner knowing. In this time she misses much of her journey. At a point she will begin to recollect and bring significance to all the parts she missed along the journey. This journey is extended upon all of life, and she has the keys to take it up, placing all her momentum on this task. Where the highest power of truth, meets the will of the intelligence - for the purity to manifest, the mind must make sense of all the senses which don’t make sense. The acceptance and embodiment of a multi dimensional consciousness.</p>
<p>Pieces</p>
<p>She can feel into the depth of the world from all angles as it revels itself through emotional waves. She senses into the places moving into a depth where she feels home in a memory, and connects to it all. She practices here, and if tapped into higher frequencies can bring this emotional expression outwards to the same degree she traveled inwards. She lives in the undersoul and raises the essence from underneath. She must tap into universal conscious stream to use regenerative love to fill all the doubts and fears. </p>
<p>Venus in The houses </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>She can sense her senses are fertile, and sh  knows herself through an awanessness that is subtly tuned to appreciate what is at the forefront of her existence. Her touch is intentional and simple, meant to draw out the depths of what is needed without force, and with gracious timing and rhythm. She has a clear view towards discovering what is deeply needed. Coming forth from the depths and to be fed from an internal stream that is stronger than the surface self. The imposter will come in and thwart the plan, but this stream knows deeply. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She moves through the world with unease as she is pulled in many directions, each one calling forward all of her. The heart and head are at odds, and she is learning to integrate yearnings into reality. One side wants to simplify and strip it all down to necessities, and another side is pulled to reveal contradicting information. The goal is to be all herself to be bare and clear and purely present to reveal the path right before her eyes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is open to receiving all of it, and is engaged as a force of self. Open to it all, but the ability to integrate and assimilate is tough as the pull outwards is stronger than inwards. The inward world is seeking a deeper link underneath all the senses. She is lighting up a this place  over time that contains the fuel to move inwards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She stays rooted inwards close to what she knows, well venturing outwards seeking worlds unknown. The world around is less alive so she seeks the unseen to fill a void.  The search is far and deep, and she feels closer to self the further she goes away. Momentarily there is a completion, but the energy fades. She is living far, but eventually the outer worlds will reveal that same void. This is a path of learning to let go and uprooting patterns to open a fresh perspective. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She works ahead of her world, and has all the gifts overflowing to present what is living inside. The job is to master timing as her vision has not yet been seen. She has created a room inside herself where she can be free and harness what lives inside, to the outer world it appears as is she has found a bubble or performance. She has given herself the right to express, and show others what can be done through this freedom. When she as at peace with herself she is at peace with her world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is here to show the other what can be done, and has a unique gift inside that when given away she finds balance inside. Love meets the earth and must be carefully planned and executed. She is pulled to fill many roles and feels diluted if she fills them, so while she finds comfort in disturbing these roles, creating her own path, others find disturbing and therefore her gift takes on many trials before she learns to leave the gates open. Present awareness means channeling her gift towards the missing pieces in the shared pattern. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is in direct and in immediate contact with her world -  working to remove all barriers towards what is desirable and what is not. She is coming to know each relationship as its own unique universe which moves through all sides of life. At first she will love through each relationship as if it were her destiny, then she will move backwards and becoming internal and then she will enter into relationships with less expectations. Met by such karmic pulls that will be hard to find a solid foundation. Each relationship has much to work on and work through, she is learning to flow with the waves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is open to the spectrum of experiences and feelings in each moment. She is open to receiving the love of the moment, however she cannot always receive the depths of the experience fully, because the world prevents us from going that far. However, since going far is how we know ourselves, we only find fragments and feelings of what it could be. An incredibly fertile ground that is plunged upon when one can go against all the intellect that holds one back from following the track of passionate intensity all the way. She will thrive when this spectrum of availability arrives </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dissolving of the ego, the point in the process where the self can go and be anywhere with anything, but each dimension deeper will peel away and unveil any grasp on the self or ego. The dimensions being experienced tends to cancel out and contradict all hiding places and definitions of self. She goes as far as she gives herself permission, revealing the full spectrum of her being, and then attempts to integrate it to an extent in the physical world. Her reaction is to follow her internal truth, and when she does so much is compromised towards the highest mountains, when internal truth arrives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is giving her knowing away, and is here to present to her truth with inspiration for the collective to unite upon. She had a generalized impersonal grasp and knows little of her inner soul, but does know her position on each issue, and has a grasp on its direction, impact and context. She has a loving openness to anyone apart of the current and change, and can open all doors of limitation. The gift arrives.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is here to stretch the fabric of the group and allows everyone the space to be at ease. It can be taken one step further if given the opportunity for complete devotion of heart and soul to take the realistic steps forth in a project and guide the group forward. She is at the edge of each breakthrough, able to grasp the next available solution. She is always available for the next stage in the process, may sometimes loose those close in exchange or a greater world view. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is so closely knit to her world, she seeks to uncover the mystery brewing under each scenario that draws her in. This sort of passion takes one to the edge of any scenario and leaves her living on the edge of deep connection of utter rejection. She is learning to see in between these streams of duality into an ocean of shared participation with the deepest oceans of human connection.**z</p>
