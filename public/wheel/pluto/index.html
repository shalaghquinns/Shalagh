To grasp that the human experience encompasses many dimensions and possibilities had not yet been played upon. Intense drive towards forward motion and future currents. Seeing open possibility in a hard headed world, when everything is alive on the surface.</p>
<p>Taurus: 1850s-1860s the earth comes alive inside the human being and we cannot explain the vastness we are tapping. Technology advancements heighten the importance of remaining natural and returning to the earth. Drawn into territory where we may feel alone, yet in the hands of angels. Those who have tapped this earth sensibility lay their eggs under the surface for growth down the line.</p>
<p>Gemini: 1880-1900: Earth comes vibrantly alive with new streams of beginnings and endings. A wave with the motion to move forward without looking back and an excitement to enter the dimension of our multidimensionality becomes appealing. No longer be held to the structures that kept the systems glued for centuries and the vision for the power of the individual, lives on.</p>
<p>Cancer 1914- 1938: World order is shattered wand darkness reigns. The problems and karma from the past surface and this generation is left to alchemize them. Lack of hope stacks up against infinite unknown.Very few can pierce through this time to become masters at weaving back lost souls to spirit connection.</p>
<p>Leo 1938-1957: Weaving together heaven and earth with a heightened sensibility of self, due to the friction of the existing contemporary context. The core of the individual is set a flame with convictions and righteous from the fragments of a destroyed world order . It takes remarkable strength to take the flame to its full potential.</p>
<p>Virgo 1957-1971: The world is taken over by rampant threats of technology, and this generation is pulled to witness and integrate many sides to become a matrix of conciseness. Ability to discern through the truth and false deception towards integrating multiple perspectives and tapping into a life stream that is un-scattered and freshly attuned.</p>
<p>Libra 1970&rsquo;s-1980&rsquo;s Many chapters unfolding revealing a new promise, with none of its permanence surfacing. A matrix of experiences and perspectives with the option to choose what is desired. Serving the image of the dream pushes us to learn how to ride waves on uncertainty.</p>
<p>Scorpio: 1980-1990s New world begins to be revealed and the old world order begins to shed its final layers. Piercing drive and awareness cuts through to reveal how long the human soul has been frozen. Freedom comes up against the densest patterns and carries an intensity and urgency.</p>
<p>Sagittarius: End of the 20th century gives life to a creative intuition that renews earth and takes it all the way. A deep awareness of the direction needed to go and truth about what it gives and what it takes internally. A sharp eye comes forth to blend and reimagine where we are moving.</p>
<p>Capricorn: 1764-1778 Witnessing their vast truth and inside vision coming alive, yet falling short in the context. A great power resonates and as the greats rise to share the frequency. Beethoven begins to stitch the seeds of heaven and earth, and bridge ethereal worlds. Work towards mastery in order to surplant the need to over throw the mundane.</p>
<p>Aquarius: 1778- 1799 revolution impulse begins its beat with the discover of Uranus. A higher power is revealed as attainable. Romanticism sparks the feeling that there is beauty in all forms of life. A direction that can be appreciated with out defining it begins to surface. The attempt to throw off the monarch comes from a new found desire to be able to walk the earth as a free being.</p>
<p>Pisces: 1800- 1823 Earth begins to sink into an understanding that provokes creation to highlight all thats been missing. Humanity fights for survival and earthly forces shed light on the dangers of a technological revolutionized society. The individual power and American dream begin to form, creating a landscape for new collective depths to be explored.</p>
<p>houses</p>
<p>1: Collective karma meets self to alchemize what has been denied and frozen over. When we can learn to forgive no matter what, the subtle body opens the door for the self to be able to carry a load and make it lighter for those around. Unconditional love for each moment becoming be fostered. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>We must constantly learn to open up to new possibilities. Puncturing our built up rational to be tested and asked that we approach without pre-existing bias. Where we are asked to see through the veil at every juncture. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fresh perspectives bring new lifestreams and we are faced with the stagnancy of patterns from all angels. Blocked expression has engulfed the self and we must meet it with spontaneousness that is open to growth rather that another reason why it cant be done. Releasing ties to expectations. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deeply pulled underneath to give life to regenerative power. Turning thoughts of engrained entrapment into fertile soil. Using a step by step steadiness to practise addressing sharply limited perspective, lightly and with patience. Not all suffering lasts forever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Profound staying power to gather forces and unite. Choosing one or 2 streams to rally self and individuals towards. Hyper individuality tends to dramatize heroic stance, and we must learn to welcome guidance. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great finger points the way to the fulfillment of the assignment . Fine tune the skills and intelligence, without explaining it, you are the person for the job We are so subconsciously moved by this job that we do not attach egoicly with the work or story, just simply doing the work. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attached to the karmic story of our relationship to reality, and attracting the same broken experience. Breaking through our deepest memory of connections and being asked to meet the world freely and right now with possibility. Playing out both sides of the equation until we can move freely from a place of vulnerability. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Living deeply and closely into the heart of the situation, and moving towards a state deeply unconditioned by limitations. The challenge will be to stick as close as possible to this path and learn that many collective patterns are designed to take this flow away. Coming up against the stream again and again to strengthen its flow. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>9.  We can see what is possible and take meeting this goal seriously. The goal is to break out of our own barriers, seeing past the rational into the possibility, and entering the adventure free from looking down or back . Captivated by the total view, taking the most direct, radically free step of internal overcoming that breaks the final barrier of self needed. </p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<p>Determining deepest needs of the community and then seeking to fulfill them. Many concerns can saturate the self. The ultimate goal is to lead others to what they truly need through their ability to embody archetypes that have yet to be defined. We are leaders, and thirsty for the next stage in human evolution that unifies heaven and earth. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embodying the permission to be anyone and anything and accepted be the group. Personal or collective dream coming to life. Representing an existing group or leading us through the unknown into a whole new stream of time. Divergent destiny, pulled out of the collective consciousness stream. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A processing system for the deepest most extreme expression of human nature. Limitless  boundaries make it hard to imagine the sensitivity of this position. A gateway to grasp, transform and transmute all that is false. The subtle notes of all horrors and wonders fully participating to conceive the inconceivable.</p>
