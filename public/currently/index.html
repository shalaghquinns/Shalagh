<p>The question what to i do with the pain of that this love causes me haunts me. What do I do with a person i love and care for so much, what do I do when they have sacrificed they whole life, done everything for me, trying to take care of me, to support me in the way that people do. But how do I say I am supported by the earth, by the power of my energy. How do I explain I have a feeling inside so strong that I do not need money to survive. Not money, but a plan. How do I explain that this is me, this is all of me, I am a spirit freed of the constraints of the world.</p>
<p>I want this so badly for everyone but mostly I want it for the people I love. especially dror. I emphasis with dror when he says he needs to know where he&rsquo;s going, I know this is his journey, I know I cannot take his plan away from him.</p>
<p>My intuition thinks its knows where its going, thinks that things have a fixed plan, but everything time we become more deeply aware of the plan, we have the position to change it. the more awareness we build about whats going on, the more deeply we can custom create our world. The more attention we give to our surroundings, the greater clarity we have around what we want, the better tools we have to design it.</p>
<p>A love letter to ellias,</p>
<p>to whom who is out ahead of me
while I have been used to everyone in my life pulling me back, into a plan, into a promise, into the structures we live through on earth, I have Elias who is puling me through. Who is doing his best job, giving his full effort to bring me beyond myself. I never know while it&rsquo;s happening, I talk to him and many things click, I don&rsquo;t see straight in the conversation, it takes me time to see the truth of what he is saying. But he takes me beyond each time, reminding me what it&rsquo;s like to live into a dimension, into a full blown experience of being human. Sometimes after our calls I feel anger, as what he tells me contradicts other people who love me. It never takes me too long to see that everything he tells me is from a deep and loving understanding, and he treads very carefully not to give too much away, just to hold the water around me as I swim through it. He knows he cannot be the one to make any decisions for me - all he does is guide and teach me how to weave in each reflection I give him. I remember he is not perfect, he is not all knowing, I see my 7th house Saturn leaning on him, and remembering how to use my highest sense of discernment to learn from what he says without getting carried solidifying my intuition.
No one in my world will every understand what this relationship is to me. My partner believes what he is capable of seeing and understanding. I try and play naive, relate to him on the level he sees it on. In the back ground I know something is simplified.</p>
<p>notes from yesterday: go with a feeling, only each day will the feeling arise and you will know what to do with it. Cultivate the feeling you want to create for yourself inside.
Amnesia- when we loose our memory we loose a sense of the true past. The truth of past</p>
<p>things Im afraid to say to dror:
when you tell me everything you do is for me I feel tremendous guilt to have to plan and sacrifice everything for myself for this relationship.</p>
<p>to the purest heart I have every known</p>
<p>So much of myself I see in you, what do you do with a heart so pure that the world can take it for granted. A big fear I have is taking the love and beautiful intentions you have for granted, you re the most giving and supportive person, friend and partner I have ever known. You sacrifice everything for the greater whole, you have sacrificed everything for me because you can see my gift, because you love me. You love me because of a gift I have that you have as well, because I have a heart as huge as you.</p>
<p>I feel in in our laughs, in the way our bodies embrace each other fully, I see it through your deep brown eyes which only search for a deep and loving understanding, I see it through your amazing friends who only have the most amazing things to say about you. I see what I love most about you in myself - in the most beautiful feeling i carry is having a heart thats all love, that moves each day feeling great and proud and confident. I have met a lot of confidence in my life, but no one carries it the way you do, the way you have nothing to prove, no one to convince, no one to win, and nothing to do but rely on your own infinite inner energy source. I see your power, I see your truth, i believe in your life path and you believe in me. Together I know we can move through anything with this power.</p>
<p>The full potential of this power is it can be trusted to be taken anywhere through the world, that we can always rely on each other because we have an inner confidence in self. We don&rsquo;t ask the other to change, we can adapt and grow through and for each other. Based on our incredible journey I imagine we will change a lot in our life time, the more we grow together the more I trust these changes. The more I see how the way we support each other will shift to meet our needs. Our strong independence is the key to the power between us. This means that the more we grow, the more we will know what we need, and we can find and ask for it from the other.</p>
<p>We each have roles in this relationship that I can see keep this engine going. I have a roll of bringing us through into unknownness. I trust in myself that what I have to give you will always be in your best and highest interest. I am learning to trust that again, through my own failure, bringing light to an unseen power and potential that each day i am seeing we are healing a trust on levels we had not yet seen. I see how telling you something so challenging allows me to be more honest with myself- seeing the things I have not expressed, and giving them a voice. In this process, as usual, more and more, each day, our love grows. We can trust this process no matter what happens, we have a love designed to grow, we have a rock solid foundation designed with stand all the fucks of being human. If my job is to bring us forward and guide us into unknown territory, I see yours as providing the support, not finically, but because you trust me, I can trust you to weave us into this earth. To take all my dreams, and guide me to make them real.</p>
<p>Dror, your awareness of whats going on in this world is something I will never be able to grasp. I trust deeply that you know how to ground a vision and make it real. To tend to the garden to foster the growth, to see where Im going and do everything to make the magic real. You push me in all the right ways, you hold the water as I swim. You never push to much, or ever try to change me. You keep showing up for my crazy world, my weird way of being, and my far far far stretched out vision, that needs you by my side to remind me I do not have infinite time here, and I need to get to work and take immense responsibility for this to come to life. No one i have ever met, or will ever meet will understand me in the ways you do. You are my perfect match, my balanced opposite, the gift i cherish the most and something I will never ver be able to wrap my mind around how this world brought us together.</p>
<p>We are at a rebalancing stage, where I am being honest with myself. I need to take what I want instead of following you, in this way I will be able to support myself finically, for we both carry a tremendous burden for you supporting me. The support that you will provide me in our life time, will not be imbalanced in the way it has been in the past year. For this I need the space and time discover how to support myself. A sad truth is I have let the world take advantage of me because I love this world, I have also taken advantage of the support you have given me because I was not claiming what I needed. We needed to go through this, but it cannot happen anymore. We are ready for a whole new stage of this relationship.</p>
<p>My promise to you is to always give you the space to become everything you dream, to be honest with you about myself, and what I see in you. I promise my heart belongs to you, not in a possessive way, but in the way the way that no matter what we go through my whole being, body and soul, is intertwined in our journey of becoming.</p>
<p>Thank you for having confidence in your way, for doing the work and showing up for yourself, and for us everyday. Your work ethic is tenacious and inspiring, and I have a lot to learn from it. Thank you for having the power and grace to listen, the highest ability to see the truth, and the strength in yourself to digest the darkness in the world. I have so much to learn from you, and you teach me everyday how to be in the big dark world, and not be so scared of it.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a child in a complex world, for being a boy who decided to asks the question, a teenager who took care of himself and traveled to india, a person who stood up for what he believes is right, who goes to protests, who shares his heart, who loves and learns from amazing women, and draws to his side the best friends in the world. Thank you for never settling for anything less than the best, for seeking the truth and standing by it, for laughing with me, for being an infinite child, for planning a family with me, for holding my body and letting every side of an orgasm move through my body, for giving and giving and giving, and for all the promises you made and kept. I see you, all the way through, and any challenge that you have I will be  here to embrace fully with all the love that you give to me.</p>
<p>writing this was so healing for myself and clarifying. I don&rsquo;t always know how to speak back the beautiful words you say to me, I just receive them with every cell in my body. But by writing I can see everything more clearly.</p>
