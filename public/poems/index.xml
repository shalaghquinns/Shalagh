      <description>&lt;p&gt;a future where everyones famous&#xA;the only reason we admire fame is because it means someone came to earth, and did what nobody else could do. They did themselves and shared something we hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet experienced. This is not going to be a very big deal in the future, this is the goal we aim for, a world where everyone has permission to do themselves and the world supports their growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
