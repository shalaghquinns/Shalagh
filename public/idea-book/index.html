          knowing less
          knowing is a form of safety
          Safety in external structure
          we are having an internal exteriepnce
          Creation is the act of making sense of an internal experience

          Algorithm puts expression into formulas
          Artists follow certain styles trends to get numerical appreciation
          Loose the need to make sense to other
          the future belongs to those who take responsibility for their internal experience

          Film story
          what films taught me about reality
          I began creating films about non sense
          the non sense began to make sense to only me
          my films began to reflect a story back to me about what I was going through inside
      
      
          Reflective reality
          external world is a reflection of our internal experience
          we rely on the external world to create our internal world. More we use external to make sense less internal makes sense
          create to make sense of what we are going through inside
          The world can become more and more revealing of our internal truth the more we see and treat it as a reflection of our inner world.
      
      
          The Creative Flip (video)
          sharing an internal world
          notice the ways you turn to the external world to guide your experience
          slowly practise ways of breaking free from acting through the experience of others
          world begins to communicate with you, and you can deepen your experience here
      
      
          sleepy pigeons
          changing the form of a memory
          if we are only focused on creating these monumental moments every moment is missing something.
          when we change the way we remember moments we change the vision for the future opens
          our memory of the past is our vision for the future.
      
      
          to capture a memory
          Memory is a vision for the future
          vision for the future becomes trapped in the boxes of other expectations
          Change the memory to open into a future
          when we do not share for the approval of others,we give ourself and others the permission to do the same
      
      
          The quantum world
          We have infinite potential
          when we trap our perception into boxes of expectations, than we are conpressing our experince
          don things without having a plan, practise intuition
          what if their is a much deeper and fuller more richer experience waiting beyond what we assume we know
      
      
          The collapse of time
          what the quantum world has to do with our experience
          When we plan and structure our time into boxes
          Our perception of time is in relationship to the quantum world.
          
      
      
          Essence of time
          Time is patterns and patterns in cycles
