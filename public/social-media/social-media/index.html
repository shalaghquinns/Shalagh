the behind the scenes
a means for the meaning
a screen for the feeling.</p>
<p>the process zine is teaching me how to follow an internal process
rather than external time.
I am learning to learn through myself,
at this point it is letting all my creations free
letting the shadow expose itself
all of this feels like Ive just be practising
becoming. I am learning I don&rsquo;t need to be liked or accepted,
I don&rsquo;t need the external approval, its not what I came for
and its not what I want deep down,
i want to be free of time,
to give myself the room for creation to flow through me.</p>
<p>this process is teaching me what I don&rsquo;t want to do,
it is showing me the shadow I have been living in.</p>
<p>do something beyond the practical
try and act a lil irrational
be cool its only natural
even facts were not factual</p>
<p>I have so much i want to say about creation time and the process we must go through,
it consumes me. I am being eaten by darkness, to move towards the light.
Its not like the light ever left though, I knew this time would always come,
I knew this about every time, and I am just participating in the process because of how much I learn from it when I do. Unless we participate in where life wants to take us,
if we shy away from ourself we can never see our own potential,
and we are going to die one day and never know what could have been.
not me, I will not die any more deaths not finding out how far I can go.</p>
