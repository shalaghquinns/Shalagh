characters on screens</p>

<p>response -ability</p>
<p>the response ability
is your ability to respond to your environment
to take responsibility
is to be in response to your world,</p>
<p>what happens is we feel our responsibility
for this world,
to be so far out of our hands,
everything about the threat of humanity is so impending
from outside of us, and from systems and programs
that are to vast to grasp,
our worlds are pulled out side of our self,</p>
<p>to take responsibility is to take
back your own response ability
into your own response system,
the internal awareness that is able to comprehend what
we are actually responsible for,
and then to take that form of responsibility
ability from that sphere of awareness,
to the response ability of your surroundings,
take this part seriously,
bring back your real world into its matter,
by changing your responsibility,
to its internal world,</p>
