      <p>The greatest danger of social media is the power it takes from actual reality. The way it strips existence of its imagined potential. Our imagination is our greatest power and we need it more than ever right now. Our imagination will pull us through this mess, but not like how we have imagined it.</p>
<p>The future has let go of the identity that comes from screens. We understand that there is no substance to numbers and likes, and instead we choose participate in the online world because it can free us to go against the ingrained pattern in real life.</p>

      <p>a streams for my dreams,
the behind the scenes
a means for the meaning
a screen for the feeling.</p>
<p>the process zine is teaching me how to follow an internal process
rather than external time.
I am learning to learn through myself,
at this point it is letting all my creations free
letting the shadow expose itself
all of this feels like Ive just be practising
becoming. I am learning I don&rsquo;t need to be liked or accepted,
I don&rsquo;t need the external approval, its not what I came for
and its not what I want deep down,
i want to be free of time,
to give myself the room for creation to flow through me.</p>

      <p>the way screens become popular was through cartoons,
we created these characters and stories and fell in love with them
then slowly we started acting like them,
like the characters in the stories we watched,
and then slowly we became them,
characters on screens</p>
<p>the screens show us what we create
reflects back into our experience
we have created a box for us to work for
a method and way for creativity to exists,
we need a character,
we need to play this game on the screen
to be cool enough to get attention,
from others,
be cool enough to get attention from yourself
to flip the reflection from the characters we became,
all the versions we took on
about the way it was suppose to look,
now we invent ourself out of that
by sharing and expressing
a world that doesn&rsquo;t make sense to anyone
but you,
we can remember how to take
responsibility for our life.</p>

<p>the process has been a surface game i invented to play into my inner world, and see where it would take me. This journey took me far off screen and showed me why sharing it and trying to make life real online was taking away from this inner journey. This zine was a deep question inside, if technology could be used to express creativity how would it look? This has been this game to remember. It is not an instagram account, it is an inward timeline, a reflection of my inner experience, and now my inner experience is coming outside of me.</p>

social group, and religon. Until now we have been connecting to people through a shared beleif systems and social structures from the world around us.</p>
<p>The internet has a power to connect us with people of the same truth,
of the same inner beleif systems, of the same inner worlds,
but the power of the beast, requires us to learn to tell a new truth,
a new story to our brothers and sisters,
one that is of an inner truth,
a true truth.
Not of the one the world around us has projected upon us,
we are made to break the image this world has projected onto itself,
because it is hurting our souls,
we are at war,
fighting our brothers and sisters, about these made up systems,
about these external games, money, numbers, power, and religion.</p>
