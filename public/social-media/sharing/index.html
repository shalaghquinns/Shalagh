<p>through learning to share a different side of an experience
we give up on my need to be approved or understood
to remember something else that technology had the power to do,
I choose to share a mirror
to what my inner world feels
I don&rsquo;t want to get fixated by these moments to create,
so I let them come to me,
and when I feel something is a part of me,
when my world mirrors itself back,
i give share it in my timeline.</p>
