when you try and capture a moment
and somethings missing
we want to capture the way it felt
the feeling can never be fully captured</p>
<p>yet we have this urge to capture the moments
to create a feeling</p>
<p>the price of the moment has gone up
the right moment captured has a worth
a value, a future, a product,
we can make a living off of capturing moments</p>
<p>but something deeply unsatisfying grows
in the eyes of the viewer
of these perfectly created feelings
as we feel all these amazing things
while watching, and leave feeling empty
devoid of creativity</p>
<p>in reality
each moment has multiple realities,
it is connected to the last moment, the one before,
it contains many perspectives,
an interior resonance that is in relationship to the environment,
and so much more depth and juice and life,
than the mental comprehensive of beautiful imagery</p>
<p>images can create an amazing feeling
but the feeling is always in reflection to what we are already going through
we can never experience a photo or a song the same way again,
the photo and song is only used to create a reflection
for what our inside was searching for</p>
<p>however when the feeling is only a reflection of the feeling
and not of the direct experience than we are not having a real feeling
because the real feeling contains multiple layers,
an inner depth, a story, a juice, a truth
something that can never be deduced to an image</p>
<p>the truth of beauty of this world
is it does not need to be recreated
for it can never be separated from time</p>
<p>beauty is only the refection of an inner experience
so the creation of beauty is not necessary</p>
<p>and ironically the realities that give us this feeling
that we yearn for,
this moments of empowerment and beauty,
the ones who have created these worlds
we imagine into</p>
<p>are not living in them</p>
<p>they are living in the process
of creating the image of a beautiful reality,
they are not themselves,
living in the same beautiful reality
they created</p>
