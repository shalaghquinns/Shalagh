      <description>&lt;p&gt;we have been taught and formed&#xA;on the need to think about our world through the frame of numbers&#xA;through money through  time&#xA;we want external guarantee and known outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We believe time is something happening outside of us,&#xA;something that the more we plan it,&#xA;the more we know it,&#xA;the more we can guarantee a numerical outcome,&#xA;the more we can receive from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;what if the gift of time is not something we can know and plan?&#xA;what if the gift is in the way it reveals itself to us in a process&#xA;through an internal experience with no external prof&#xA;what if all the need to prove our value stops us from the greatest value&#xA;and the greatest value we have is not something that can be shared with anyone&#xA;how does that change your experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;i don&amp;rsquo;t make art to make art&#xA;its an experiment&#xA;to see if I could trust in time&#xA;to see if I could let my inner world be,&#xA;what would it have to show me&#xA;to see what the creative process had to say when I trusted in it,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;what i learned was, this process did not want to be planned,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;when I surrendered I was given something&#xA;beyond what I could have expected&#xA;the process wants to remain unknown&#xA;when I didn&amp;rsquo;t confine the experience to money or numbers or time,&#xA;It always led me to create a different exchange&#xA;that allowed something much stronger to flow through&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I has a classic experience where I saw a wall that looked like it could use a mural and talked to the owner. At first he&amp;rsquo;s super stoked about the idea, we talk about a vision, I show him my previous work, we get the excited about the idea of the art, and then begin to talk logistics. Getting the paint? sure he can pay for it! Then i mention gently, that ive done alot of work for free, and I just cant do that anymore - I should get paid for the work. He agrees, but the entire demeanour of the conversation changes. Now things are serious, now comes the determining factor, will there even be this beautiful imaginary project if the numbers don&amp;rsquo;t make sense. There comes a pause, and my partner and him start talking in Hebrew, I see the man back down saying , loh loh, the translation is no, no in english. The idea is cancelled, a number was mentioned beyond what made sense to the owner and the moments over.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;the collective is drowning in itself&#xA;everyone must be protective in their shell against the need to be sold,&#xA;in these hotspots, in these places where we have identified as national monument,&#xA;where the collective has collective in a swarm around places,&#xA;where the number of people grew at the same time as the number of business,&#xA;and where you couldn&amp;rsquo;t come around a corner without trying to be sold something&#xA;I was in the heart of where western civilization was born&#xA;I was in the birth place of this idea,&#xA;and it had flipped inward on itself,&#xA;the vendors and the people faced an inward tension and anxiety to swim in a current that was over crowded and everyone had to fight for a spot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;everything is my world is opposing each other. Ellias contradicts dror. My career fuelled by freedom, contradicts my relationship. I have to explain that for me the future is open, it&amp;rsquo;s an open promise to myself to live each day and see where it takes me. I can not control this request, this was my work, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t fuelled by money it was fuelled by hope. When I made this promise to myself I faced many problems, like not having money, this was hard but as I continued to follow it I never one felt like I wasn&amp;rsquo;t supported by the world. I am proud of myself for not relying on money, I feel ultimately liberated for getting away without it. When I met my partner we wanted to plan the future, he wanted a plan, he did not have the trust I had in the unknown. Because of this when we went to Isreal money became a problem, the imbalence became a problem. I was shown that the need to plan the world, stopped me from trusting in it. Everyone in my life has been following a plan and telling me I need money to live, everyone is telling me the colour of the water is green, but I am only seeing blue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;what&amp;rsquo;s Israel been like?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;while I&amp;rsquo;ve been hear for just under 3 months,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and am just beginning to understand the intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The truth is so complex and deeply woven into the systems and culture here. But it is not talked about, or recognized outwardly. The people seem to be facing an itch, and the itch is very real.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;when I first met dror I was scared to enter water so deep. It was scary at first to see into the problems he faced being Israeli, being jewish, and being the time. But this was just the beginning. Dror&amp;rsquo;s gift was his open heart to be able to welcome in all sides of the world. I realized later that this was a symptom of being exposed so many perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;in the most pure fashion, right straight and clear towards the people who align with me. They bring out my power, showing me it is huge. They bring up my fear of the size, they bring up the possibility of balance between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I went my whole life being trapped in a world I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand and I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel I belonged to. Surrounded by a problem I could not grasp, by a world that was to powerful for me to handle. I hid from the size of the earth, i hid from my dream, I has to hide, I had to blend in, I had to get along.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;my dearest dror, my big soft beautiful love,&#xA;I am writing you this today to move through some feelings I am having the trouble finding the words, maybe this will help me.&#xA;As I imagined wanting to write this I noticed a fear that came up, and saw a pattern in the relationship I had yet to see before. Our deep encouragement and love for each other, our foundation of building each other up, and making sure the other knows that they are the one for us, I noticed makes it challenging for me to bring up things that are not on this note.&#xA;Through many pages of writing this morning, I discovered that the need for my deepest communication is coming up now. A lot of it is in regards to learning how to express my boundaries, ask for what I need, and ultimately use my voice to its full potential. The world is telling that if I can find the words, if I can speak up for what I feel everything then every door that comes to be can be opened with grace.&#xA;On one layer this is showing up with Chen and the money, I am realizing I can have everything I want if I can ask for it. With this option open to me, I am able to see how much fear I have about asking for what I want and need.&#xA;On another layer this is happening with you, I feel fear about hurting you, and it&amp;rsquo;s creating a block in my heart and in my body. I cant escape a truth that I feel an attraction to this person. It snuck up on me in a weird way that I want to share with you in a fearlessly. When I first met him I was excited about being involved in this project, the more i&amp;rsquo;ve understood this project the more I saw how we are doing similar things in different ways. I can see how the universe is trying to help us bring the future alive for others. I have yet to meet someone who is doing it more than me, someone who is more obsessed with with creating a world that fosters the growth of the individual. I am experiencing a form of attraction I have never experienced before, and I want use our amazing communication skills to speak about our boundaries around me exploring it further.&#xA;Something I want to mention is how much love the thought of exploring this has brought into my life. For the connection I am experiencing with this person and very different from the one I am experiencing with you. The contrast is becoming clear to me that this is someone I would only want in my life in a very specific way, and it makes me see that he is not someone I would ever want to marry and combine together in life. His energy is far too outward than what I need. It makes me see even clearer that you are the one I will be having children with, you are the one I can spend the rest of my life with, and this person is here to teach me something very specific that will help me expand into the world.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Over the past few days I have felt a pain in my heart that I know you can feel. The pain is all the fear and guilt I have about having these feelings,&#xA;Im not sure what to do about this only that I wanted to speak about it with you on the phone when&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;March 17th 1996 - the next galactic wave&#xA;Dear Ellias,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The body is hollow. Celestial fluid can play through the body, we do it all the time. Nothing is so very solid as we think. This is very fortunate, because the body is hollow the interior life forces are able to play through each layer of the body. They can bring in wave on wave of galactic forces - galaxy into life into matter, is the wave of time. But a body has remained somewhat static during the modern times, it has solidified into what seems like a very substantial, dense, heavy way of operating. Most of this energy in slowing down to almost inert levels, feels like it is not energy any longer but rather a thick consistency of &amp;ldquo;this is the way it always was and always will be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;march 20. 1996&#xA;dear Ellias, there are traditions around drying that endure.&#xA;It was a scared passage before the scared withdrew from outer human awareness. *&#xA;When religion and symbolism trumped the outer literal awareness.*&#xA;Sacred death was the only way to go, we have never let go of the vision of sacred death, we simply reserve it for the few, the rare ones, and we envy them for still being able to unite with spirt as they die. &lt;em&gt;Sacred death is a myth and a memory, the little of what remains from the vision of a spirit world.&lt;/em&gt; But huge inroads have been made in modern times, in the human capacity to sustain the scared state of being, even at death. &lt;em&gt;As spirit weaves its way back into collective awareness we&amp;rsquo;re beginning to find a way to bridge the power of the individual with the power of the earth. In previous times the individual was at mercy to the earth, but as we&amp;rsquo;ve grown away from our reliance on time, as our basic needs are finally met, as we finally have the room to ask for more, the power of the individual can come home to the earth for the first time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;september 22 1999&#xA;the future surge in the death realms at the turning point in time&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;dear inner family,&#xA;the primacy of spirit connection is coming on alive amongst the living as a felt need, a desperate hunger in this changing crucial time. But people have burned their bridges to the wolds beyond, they have taught themselves not to go there for fear of deluding the self with idol fantasies, best to stay where we are and deal with what is right. So of us cast off our physical form among the dead, then we look back out there to the world of the living, the once born, and we here the cry, feel the need, get inside of the critical nature of what each one among the living is send out on subconscious frequency saying is there anybody here to help, is there any body I can believe in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;we want our life to mean something&#xA;we need a reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the reason was survival.&#xA;Now we are here surviving,&#xA;doing much more than just surviving&#xA;and we still need a reason.&#xA;we can&amp;rsquo;t bare being helpless&#xA;for it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense&#xA;to just be here and not have hope&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;hope waits around each corner,&#xA;hope has many streams of awareness inside&#xA;like a dice, hope has many sides,&#xA;something is bound to land&#xA;like a dice, the hope is cut by corners&#xA;and edges that slice it into a shape with sides&#xA;we loose the whole picture&#xA;the meaning is fragmented&#xA;cut by the need for numbers,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;science likes to recognize alot of the characteristics about the physical reality,&#xA;turns out the more we notice about how the physical reality work,&#xA;the more we can know how to make it work for us,&#xA;in this quest for more and more knowledge,&#xA;we forgot to look and seek deeper into the question of why?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;not why plants go through photosynthesis,&#xA;and all the deeper and deeper ways&#xA;that this creates and expresses whats going on around us,&#xA;but why does any of this happen,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;always changes&#xA;we are always expanding on our ability to communicate&#xA;we have compressed that ability&#xA;in this time and space,&#xA;as we have simaltainously exanding on our capability&#xA;to communiate, we have lost parts of our nature,&#xA;and are having to regain them&#xA;we are having to rember that communicate&#xA;is not depenading on numbers&#xA;because what we have done&#xA;is created the sellable characters to eachother,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We engage in learning so that we make more and more sense of our experience. This is a corse designed to teach you how to make sense of your world from the inside out, instead of looking to the world the outside to create your world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We will explore our reliance on the external world to make sense to us and the way our perception of external time provokes us to make sense based on external systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the memory of the past effects the vision of the future&lt;/strong&gt;- the way we remember events creates the pathway for us to form the future. Every future movement is made from a memory, everything we do comes from the memory of what we have done. When we deepen into the memory, then we can extend in to our future. By altering the way we envision the past we can remember how to be in the present, which is the future unfolding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;a future where everyones famous&#xA;the only reason we admire fame is because it means someone came to earth, and did what nobody else could do. They did themselves and shared something we hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet experienced. This is not going to be a very big deal in the future, this is the goal we aim for, a world where everyone has permission to do themselves and the world supports their growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;the camera paradox - when your&amp;rsquo;e doing something cool, we are pulled to want to capture it, but when we capture it it never lives up to the actual moment. And if we do find a way to capture it that makes the moment seem as cool as it was, then there is often so much effort gone into capture the moment so that it looks cool, that the actual coolness of the moment is drained.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;the process zine is like a joke&#xA;in that i never know where its going on,&#xA;but it always has a punch line to give me,&#xA;a funny way that makes everything it did before&#xA;make sense&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this project as a metaphor for trusting the creative process,&#xA;I wanted to see what was meant to learn from this process and the project&#xA;because the creative stream I would use to practise documenting and following this thing i trusted so deeply in,&#xA;the process,&#xA;and what happened was a deepening,&#xA;each layer would open me into a vaster understanding,&#xA;I began by eliminating any timeline I had on the project,&#xA;then I had to eliminate the need to share the process,&#xA;then it opened into many streams and sides&#xA;I began breaking down the natural process of creation through the stars&#xA;and creating my own language which taught me I had to&#xA;find another way of understanding this experience&#xA;and then I had to loose the need to understand it and wrap my head around it,&#xA;and now I am playing through multiple streams&#xA;different games on different layers of experiences&#xA;in things we call instagram accounts&#xA;and each one signifies a different layer of my conscious experience&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The greatest danger of social media is the power it takes from actual reality. The way it strips existence of its imagined potential. Our imagination is our greatest power and we need it more than ever right now. Our imagination will pull us through this mess, but not like how we have imagined it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The future has let go of the identity that comes from screens. We understand that there is no substance to numbers and likes, and instead we choose participate in the online world because it can free us to go against the ingrained pattern in real life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;the way screens become popular was through cartoons,&#xA;we created these characters and stories and fell in love with them&#xA;then slowly we started acting like them,&#xA;like the characters in the stories we watched,&#xA;and then slowly we became them,&#xA;characters on screens&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the screens show us what we create&#xA;reflects back into our experience&#xA;we have created a box for us to work for&#xA;a method and way for creativity to exists,&#xA;we need a character,&#xA;we need to play this game on the screen&#xA;to be cool enough to get attention,&#xA;from others,&#xA;be cool enough to get attention from yourself&#xA;to flip the reflection from the characters we became,&#xA;all the versions we took on&#xA;about the way it was suppose to look,&#xA;now we invent ourself out of that&#xA;by sharing and expressing&#xA;a world that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to anyone&#xA;but you,&#xA;we can remember how to take&#xA;responsibility for our life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;there has been something in side me baking,&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;its been life times in the making,&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;this meal that i&amp;rsquo;ve been craving&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;is finally ready for the saying&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the process has been a surface game i invented to play into my inner world, and see where it would take me. This journey took me far off screen and showed me why sharing it and trying to make life real online was taking away from this inner journey. This zine was a deep question inside, if technology could be used to express creativity how would it look? This has been this game to remember. It is not an instagram account, it is an inward timeline, a reflection of my inner experience, and now my inner experience is coming outside of me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;what technology is giving us is a direct reflection of self&#xA;we are given all the worlds we could have to reflect our truth,&#xA;in social media we are given a display of the worlds we think are true,&#xA;the worlds we are attracted to, the ones we believe in, the sides we love,&#xA;we follow&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;when technology began it was more a reflection of what technology could do,&#xA;everything was just a display of anything, because no one knew what the internet was for&#xA;slowly became a vessel to discover ourself through,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;the internet has a beautiful power,&#xA;to connect us&#xA;gives us endless possibility to interact with the people of our kin,&#xA;our our truth in a new form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Until now our connection to each other has been hindered by race,&#xA;social group, and religon. Until now we have been connecting to people through a shared beleif systems and social structures from the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The internet has a power to connect us with people of the same truth,&#xA;of the same inner beleif systems, of the same inner worlds,&#xA;but the power of the beast, requires us to learn to tell a new truth,&#xA;a new story to our brothers and sisters,&#xA;one that is of an inner truth,&#xA;a true truth.&#xA;Not of the one the world around us has projected upon us,&#xA;we are made to break the image this world has projected onto itself,&#xA;because it is hurting our souls,&#xA;we are at war,&#xA;fighting our brothers and sisters, about these made up systems,&#xA;about these external games, money, numbers, power, and religion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have developed a pattern of attempting to know the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we love to plan our time, to make enough numbers, feed our tummies and make sure we have a home. That baseline pressure seeps into the way we make sense of the whole of life, creating the feeling that the more we know and gather from this experience the safer we are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a natural symptom at this point in time, for it was this outward pressure that created all the systems we form our lives around. All the ways we get our food and home and money and clothes and job and schools, all of it came from the search to know more about our world and ensure we are safe here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why the book should be written?&#xA;Whats it about?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Along with rising interest in spirituality comes an increasing amount of scepticism and withdrawal because of the distance the subject matter carries from our reality. For many the subject of spirituality carries undertones that don&amp;rsquo;t align with the logical and rational world. There exists a gap between the world of spirit and very factual, time, and money driven world that we&amp;rsquo;re working with. As conflict increases within the current climate, so does the need for a solution that integrates the experience of spirit into the rational world. This book deals with the root question that started the discussion of spirit and the one we all face regardless of our beliefs, what happens when we die.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;first&#xA;we are brought into the centre of our most essential self where a core power remains as the world current fluctuates around. The senses and perception delicately stream the world through and creates a seemless relationship to the moment. The hope is to meet each moment a new so as not be caught in a previously experienced story. The power of the first house is in its openness and powerful centre that is alway open to give and receive new experiences. Everything is always changing, but whats essential stays. Through staying tuned in we become a vessel to sift through chaos and cling to what is true. We learn not overly consume our vitality and become in-tune with its constantly feeding rythmn. When we are really here we are accompanied by a pulse that will drift us naturally into each passing moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;march 20. 1996&#xA;dear Ellias, there are traditions around drying that endure.&#xA;It was a scared passage before the scared withdrew from outer human awareness. Sacred death was the only way to go, we have never let go of the vision of sacred death, we simply reserve it for the few, the rare ones, and we envy them for still being able to unite with spirt as they die. But huge inroads have been made in modern times, in the human capacity to sustain the scared state of being, even at death. This kind of passage has been supplanted fro the many by the inevitably of profane death, this is understanding because all of us are wrapped about in the tight net of the modern ideology, and the modern ideology states that there is no immortal soul and that each one when they die must face a vast abyss broadly speaking taking the profane death, as the only option is the universal agreement now.  A third kind of death also exists, it is the wave of the future I call it radical death, this is what im involved with completely, and the terms of it are to take the facaet of profane death that s vitally real, which is the loss of faith of something outside what we can directly experience for ourself (49:55) and combine his with the aspect of saced death that is most indispensable, which is to awaken to who we really are and what we belong to essentially in the act of dying. Radical death also brings into play a third and mighty factor that changes everything, let us first explore sacred death and profane death polarity in a fresh way, then we will be able to see how the radical death fuses these yet leaps beyond them all together.&#xA;Sacred death was always intended to be a deeply inward passage from one realm of god to another. If it was seen and felt to be keyed to assisting and mediating the passge from earth earth to heavene to take up the greater life beyond the physical. this much is obvious, profane death is now preceved as a mechanically driven empting of bodily life. The body seizes to work and we cant us it anymore, what ever beleifs or expectation we might consol our self with we shall be forced to give up the only life we know to take our chances on the dark unknown. It is a great loss, but it is also just how it is in this world, sad yet not all that important really, such is the basic picture. At the core of each of these models are many fascinating pictures, issues realizations, vision and experiences, most of which elude surface awarness all togther.&#xA;Let us now do complete justice to both of these realms of death. Sacred death was conceived in triumphant terms, the world was not all the real. the heavens we the greater destination, and the essence of our triumph was to be permitted to participate in a great adventure. We knew our bodies could not hold more than a fraction of our souls and our spirts, it was so clear to everybody that we dwelled beyond this life, so death was a nture counter part in every sense. Thats the beauty of sacred death was the longing in the heart satisfied, the deeper stirrings of our beings given their creative response by the angels, and divine forces. We were met by death transformed by it, profoundly transported to our greater destination. It was more miracle than anything else and given if most of us could not understand the whole of what this involved, might not remember to much about it, we knew it was a death designed for us, and we were ready for, even as we also saw a fullness in life before death, death was tied.&#xA;Profane death is primally a stark confrontation with ones one personal exisistance coming to a sudden abrupt hault, and being asked to find some way to more futher along by tapping our own inner resources, death is felt to be a terrible thing. Its only redemption lies in the one who is dying being able to discover a path which is real for them, and can be followed, only when courage and great struggle lead beyond, the brutal grave. The power in profane death is mustered within the stark will to come to ones self in the fires of burning up and losing ones life so decisively. It is an individual matter, each one is compelled to either loose everything, in the vapid nothingness, or to find a treasure that could never be assumed and is very hard earn whenever it is grasped.&#xA;Segments of humanity are draw back to scared death and other strictly go with the profane death, there are many who combine convictions in birth directions, we can see in the many current revolutions around death and near death each side and both together in a fascinating combination, most of those who seek a greater meaning in death are drawn back to the scared death of old, whether it is Tibetan Buddhism, alternative healing, the hostess movement or perhaps all of the traditional streams and convictions, the scared death calls us to rediscover its fruits. However it is all to easy to relax back into that façade of sacred death which we have evolved beyond and can retreat to in idealistic sentiment, but it is not really true. Profane death has taught us that each one must stay within their own immediate experience and be as vibrantly committed to their journey on its own terms as they can ever be. The clock cannot be turned back, it is so consoling to return to spirt roots in deeply uncertain times, but the truth is that profane death is in many ways an advance from the sacred death of old. One particular example must sufice; the side of sacred death which had to be put behind us at all costs is the perpetual dreaming into a mute surrender to the infinite power as living in the heavens as where we truly belong. This is a blasphemy on the earth experience, I will not go for it at all. Profane death lead us by the hand to recognize that we are very involved now with this earth and this body, and we cannot lightly leap forth into infinite brightness and just be glad to be done with mortal limitation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aries&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;self becomes empowered by itself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All sides of self activated into central core current. We comes up against the shadow self. We are stuck on the truth of our existence, stark naked and honest. We begin Overflowing with the wonder of discovery. Becoming consumed by the upward direction of inner spirit. We bring spirit down by expressing it through the contact of senses on earth. Becoming divided by the rational earth and the direction of inner sprit. Life becomes a game of teasing in between the lines. The vision of the future must integrate the past. The rational side comes up against our need to make change. The higher self intervenes and becomes a central observer to our reality. We are faced with a continuous awakening to a higher presence. Forces ask us to strengthen by building up resistance from all in directed karma. Allowing us to become on our own path no matter what. We become plugged into the awareness of the unique self. Start cooking up our own raw intelligence from within. Senses become deeply in tune with the internal ripple of our experience. We come into presence within to be set free from our ego. Ego can no longer dictate our course and we move from a force within. The being is empty of identity and only moves from necessary action. All that is cultivated within begins to come true. We are taken by storm to let the journey of dreams unfold. Joy and freedom lead the way of self discovery. Our resources are stored within us waiting for the right time for them to be released. We gather remarkable inner strength and are stimulated by our destiny. Being able to do anything externally but cannot deny the shadow of experience. Greater forces intervene to accompany a destiny to make sure it will be fulfilled. These greater forces give light to the hidden parts of darkness. The image of who we are is dissolved. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;happy birthday Saturn. My chest felt so full this morning, i woke up to a feeling in my spine that had to get itself moving. It was the kind of anticipation I had waited my whole life for, and now it was coming. now I would make it into being. Now i would tell the story of my life.But it had to be slowly, to recokon with each  pice of its created form. I had been at work for years and now it was coming true. Not in one day, as a slow fade.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;it started with the perception of time. It was clear to me as a little girl, something was going on behind the seems of all the planning adults were doing. There seemed to be another current creating this whole experince, and these adults seemed to be more in response to it, than they we creating with it. Much focus on time, getting on time, doing on time, having a good time. And yet something else seemed to persist stronger under all this planning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;in university i was addicted to adhd pills&#xA;all my energy went into fulfilling the world outside of me,&#xA;when I found yoga I learned how to fulfill my inner world&#xA;I fell in love with the internal process of that was unfolding inside me&#xA;I became obsessed with astrology for it was the only thing I could find that gave credit to this internal process&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I studied it for years but could never understand where it came from&#xA;or why any of these charastictics came from&#xA;everything felt diluted and dumbed down into basic personality traits&#xA;then I discovered these 2 books&#xA;one went into each degree in the 360 degree pattern&#xA;the other went into each planet in all the signs and houses&#xA;they did not talk about the way astrology existed on the outside,&#xA;and instead focused on the inward experience&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;it began with religion,&#xA;Organized religion turned our life in to the stage to work for something we receive when we leave this planet. The value of our experience was given over to god. Rules and formulas began to structure our behaviour on large scale. The church created a set of rules under the name of god, for us to behave. Our sense of self and who we were, came from our relationship to god - from a reference that has been defined for us. This taught the collective to rely on an external definition to create a sense of self. Religion had us working for the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;the first picture, the initial vision, the moment of impact, the channel of creativity, this is what is meant to be followed and trusted in.&#xA;In a world always focused on a creative projects final destination we give no credit to the initial vision. It gets revised, it can be played and and shifted on the ipad and photoshop. We never work with a mistake, we just erase and redo on the search for perfection. Taking the picture again and again until its perfect.&#xA;In this hunt, we have forget a nature of what creativity is, a moment of impact followed through, taken each moment to address what is there, to deal the real constraint of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before infinity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before this modern world, filled with millions of possibilities and infinite ways to make and use numbers, our sphere of focus was contained into the world around us, meeting our basic needs so we could survive. Our lives were simpler, we dealt with problems we don&amp;rsquo;t deal with today. We did not have the possibility to participate in infinite ways to do what we wanted with our time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;the effect of numbers is a result&#xA;of our experience of time.&#xA;numbers have created multiple streams in this shared reality&#xA;that cause us to rely on validate, and make sense of our time through their systems&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This piece explores the rise in popularity and reliance on numbers, and our slowly built dependancy on this created system. We will see how the use of numbers came to ripple so deeply into the collective psych and the way we form, comprehend and understand reality. Numbers are not just used to plan our time, and give us a salary, they carry an energy of certainty, of calculation, and of validating our self.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The world starts to make sense to me instead of me trying to make sense of it.&#xA;I become the listener the observer and my experince becomes the conversation.&#xA;Everywhere I go it has something to teach me, to show me about hw it is connecting to my inner experinces. Nothng is forgein all is welcome, when you trust the process.&#xA;It is much more than just casually witnessing you reality go by,&#xA;to trust in the process is to actually do something with it, and then see whee it has to take you,&#xA;this is not a paassive exsistance, it is a persuasive one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Underneath the sea of infinite scrolling is the desire to give our time away and make it worth something to someone else. We share stuff and cool moments and all sides of our life and what we are saying underneath the surface is I want to take your time, I want to get your attention. We are taking something from each other with this need to entertain, we are feeding our friends, followers, and the world we love, with more and more information. Maybe this information is helpful, but is it helpful that we provoke others to rely on these screens to receive what we need? and what are we taking from their experience by providing this entertainment?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;to tell the truth is hard, we all want a nice story, we all want to be insightful and innocent, powerful and truthful. We cannot escape the truth, it will haunt us until we can express it. It will hang out on our shoulder warping and twisting this world around it. If we do not speak our truth then everything will reflect back through the lies we told. We have to opportunity to free ourself, to see through all of it, but it takes a lot of courage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Each step we take, each move we make is based on the memory of where we are going, of what we are doing.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Libra Earth: Submerged in the collective undercurrent and feeling like there is no room for any new individual. This energy is hard to take, and means we meet our connections with an undercurrent infused with anger and a drive to remove all closeness. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aries Sun: We are infused with a spark and direction forward that blows away the clusters of everything one cannot meet. The gates are open for a new consciousness to witness its aliveness. Taking this star all the way is to set this a fresh pace to allow others to be fully and unapologetically themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The sun gives the energy, and the moon brings it down into earthy rhythm giving on a playground to come into self and follow their destiny.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sun conjunct Moon: In tune with instincts and able to take the steps forward to participate readily and willingly towards ones own becoming. awaiting the space where full embodiment can stream through fluidly. Propelled by destiny, yet unable to move into this space until the instinctual knowing arises. No pretending, the patience of intuition, knowing where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aries: Quick sharp discovery response to surroundings, attempting to divide the world into right and wrong. A dualistic perspective, charged and determined to come out on top being right. The internal drama is hot, and he plays out his reason why hard. As much as he reveals as the good guy, will be as much as is obstructed to reveal a contradicting perspective. Learning not to let the dialect consume him to leave space to see in between the lines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aries: Aware of our concerns and directing them forward to widen the space. Learning to integrate the concerns of the world with the concerns of self. When tuned in he can use this energy to widen the social sphere for everyone, but when he feels like his ideas are not respected by the world, he turns to dominance and aggression. Here it is clear he is his own worst enemy, and is learning to respect his own ideas. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t need approval to be himself, but he does need to approve himself, to be approved by others. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aries: 1860’s A serge to discover emerges and the sense that the old structures are becoming powerless pushes a break through to a new living future. A need to reform and advocate for change, passionately streams through as a beacon of destiny. Each one on their own journey, trampling over each other in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taurus: 1870-80’s Earth begins to surrender to the forces of human will. Amplified growth in industry ignites new found external potential. Underneath a magical time of rebirth is occurring where we begin to see the earth a living light, alive with forces beyond what had ever been possibly imagined.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aries: 1820-1850 A world centred around personal life presents the possibility for new potential. To grasp that the human experience encompasses many dimensions and possibilities had not yet been played upon. Intense drive towards forward motion and future currents. Seeing open possibility in a hard headed world, when everything is alive on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taurus: 1850s-1860s the earth comes alive inside the human being and we cannot explain the vastness we are tapping. Technology advancements heighten the importance of remaining natural and returning to the earth. Drawn into territory where we may feel alone, yet in the hands of angels. Those who have tapped this earth sensibility lay their eggs under the surface for growth down the line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aries: A striking force becoming vibrantly present with a piercing desire to move anything that gets in the way of the truth unfolding. Sharp attention to what is meant to move, and whatever is causing a disturbance will be removed uncompromisingly. We are reckoning with defeat from karmic experiences that have devastated a spirit. We are powered beyond our pity with an intense focus on the present. This is the journey where the mental focus is tested, tried and strengthened to move past any doubts of a past swamped in depths.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aries: 1920s and 30s&amp;rsquo; We are stung with an entirely new impulse to take action as the divide between the world becomes too hot to handle. Overtaken by an impulse to get on with future and weaving into everyday. Working to take our passion from its wild frenzy into a focus that can reorient itself to a new life force.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taurus: Mid 1930s The earth is alive with new design and potential visions for the future. We participate with the  electric state and impulse for the future. The vision of a new earth is an obvious and inevitable outcome and no one can deny it is being birthed a new way of being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aries: We sees ourself in the world and seek to discover who we are though the other. Constantly discovering the feeling the other creates in our own heart. The playground of relationships continues to expand as long as the other can stand its ground and give her the space to dance around, if the other is just recitable as she, she will recognize her loneliness. That she is seeking a piece of herself in the other. She will join into a relationship with herself, to discover the missing piece she was seeking in the other. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;the conflict is not with the identity it is the way we form our identity. How we can form it together around a main idea. We must central our forces around a main idea within the identity of ourself. There are o many conflicts within conflicts. One side beleives in beleiving in something else outside of itself, the right side wants a leader, it wats someone to tell them what to do.the left side wants themslefs, they want to spread. they cannot unite in the same way as the right. It is not just a conflict between 2 groups of people it is the conflict behnd what we are fighting for. While the left takes up its own path of self identiy, and then forms its belief system around, its journey, passion, hearts path, to choose a cause that benifits the whole. The left will fight for the future. While the right is fighting to maintain, to stay the same, to protect their identity, which is tied into the pattern they have always known. There is no searching for expansion of knowledge, of insight, their is a guard up. They want the land, they want the known, they dont want chaos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;i always had a feeling I would have to get over what people thought of me, and I wondered how I would ever get there. I got so good at being great for others, how could I let this image free.&#xA;Israel is spitting truth in my face in the most beautiful tragic and mesmoring ways, i am forgetting whats its like to care what other think of me. My old life in Canada feels like a dream I cant remember how it felt to be there. Only the images reply in my mind about the person I tried so hard to be.&#xA;I never felt at home in Canada, I felt like an alien. Someone way far removed from its context.&#xA;Here in Israel I feel I have met my people again. These people are faced with the deep complex truth of reality, each one of them has to deal with the dark shadows of life in there own way. No one can pretend here. I came from pretend land, where the only problems we must face are domestic. I came from a safe space, I came from protection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;we are a part of a game. &amp;ldquo;god creation or whatever has invented for us a place and time and space for the whole to come home to. It was created invented a system that would play out all sides of experience,to bring the experience closer to soul. Each individual was a part of the whole coming home, and each one was responsible for addressing sides of the pattern, so that the whole dish can be cooked, and eventually distilled back to its core.It was the journey, the process of this alchemy , we are meant to come and experience. In each life time, following a strand of continuously, constantly weaving and forming like a dna strand. We must respect each-other for their part in the pattern.We must remember for ourself, to remember for those around.We have the opportunity to create tremendous waves through out ability to follow the natural path of creation.To understand what is compromising the system as a part of understanding of self.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe we have to give more value to the time unfolding inside of us&#xA;it appears our world has found a numerical system for naming and identifying time&#xA;into money and numbers, and this system in no way gives credit to the&#xA;mystery seeking to unfold from within.&#xA;we must begin the shift in our world&#xA;through the perception of time,&#xA;once we can recognize that we&#xA;are ourself a product of creation,&#xA;their are no facts, and we are a living perception,&#xA;then we can begin to shift our values from&#xA;relying on and cultivating external truth,&#xA;to embodying nonsense.&#xA;We can loosen the need to reinforce plans&#xA;and make sure everything is right,&#xA;when we can see that nothing was right or wrong,&#xA;that it was all happening as a part of the creative process.&#xA;When we can understand this and apply this to our lives&#xA;then our we become less driven towards controlling the external processes,&#xA;and begin to listen to the subtitles of the internal processes which allow us&#xA;to sync with the existing flow rather than&#xA;calculate it and consume it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;we give the external world a lot of credit for how we feel.&#xA;We make it seem like how we feel comes from the external experience.&#xA;But no matter what experience we&amp;rsquo;re feeling, it remains inside.&#xA;We can&amp;rsquo;t create anything in the external world, without creating it first inside of us.&#xA;Everything is happening inside of us, not one person living the same world.&#xA;and yet the external world does everything it can to attempt find&#xA;ways of validating and knowing&#xA;ourself from an outer known perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
