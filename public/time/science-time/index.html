<p>all the science and all the unknown answers its searching for
are all saying the same thing
because we are thinking about it in one lens
but as soon as we get down to the particle layer
the lens itself switches,
the observer creates the reality of the particle,
as soon as we enter the quantum worlds,
the laws change
we cannot measure things in the same way
the same things don&rsquo;t apply
quantum entanglement, string theory,
quantum field theory,
all say the the same thing,
that the time we feel is not real like we imagine,
this does not mean we cant imagine it
we just have to imagine beyond the reality that we created,</p>
<p>we created a number, and money driven world,
where everything is calculated through time,
but what is time beyond this self created world we imprinted on it,</p>
<p>time is patterns,
cycles of patterns,
traveling at different rates,
in different ways, through multiple layers,
at ever moment, to keep this whole system going</p>
<p>this is happened in the cell
all the to the stars,
we are patterns in patterns, it woven and connected
as refections to each other</p>
<p>no this is where the science gets weird,
we are able to observe all of this and notice the patterns
create formulas, and create with the patterns,
extract the material of the pattern,
this is the reality that we functions through,</p>
<p>however reality shifts when we recognize that
we are not only observing the patterns in patterns
but we are the pattern,
it is our observation of the experience,
the experience of the individual
that is playing a role in the pattern of the whole,</p>
<p>we are not separate from the whole
even through our individual experience that is different from everyone,
this difference is what connects us,
and what creates the bigger picture, and momentum for creation</p>
<p>our experience is not an accident
it is woven into time,
everyone here plays a role in the act of creation
we generate just enough donald trumps
to keep the pendulum swinging</p>
<p>its not the leaves and the stem that keep the plants growing,
and creation rolling,
its the whole experience that the plant is going through that keeps it moving
this is the same for us,
it is the whole experience that keeps the pattern of creation in sync</p>
<p>each one of us is having a specific experience,
that is a part of a pattern,
within a pattern that are all connected,
the experience is connected to the body,
the body is connected to the earth,
the earth is a part of the planets,
the planets connect to experience,</p>
<p>the pattern is a pattern in a pattern
the time is a pattern in a pattern
the energy a pattern in a pattern
everything is patterns in patterns,</p>
<p>the art is a time in a pattern
the money is the time in a pattern
the thoughts are the time in a pattern
so whats the time on earth</p>
<p>its 15 minutes half past four,
10 minutes max
times at my door,
the numbers make my body sore,
but I cant help but want some more,</p>
<p>another worth fighting for,
another day while im in war</p>
<p>ill get out of this head im in
ill dream it up,
ill live it big,
one day that waits, inside of me,
it calls my name so silently
its seems like it waits done the line,
but inside already alive,</p>
<p>i hope I sound cliche to you,
I  puke</p>
<p>that is part of the planets
and a part of the stars,
and we in ourself are also the layers of pattern within ourself</p>
<p>the reason why this is so hard to grasp
is because it goes against the whole game we are playing,
it requires us to make sense of time in a whole new way
when we see that we are responsible for our own individual creative potential,
rather than responsible for the problem with the system,
then we are changing the problem, and find the solution where the problem was coming from,
inside our individual experience,
not outside in the world,</p>
<p>we see we are conn</p>
