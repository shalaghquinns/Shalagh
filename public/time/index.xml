      <description>&lt;p&gt;everything is happening inside itself&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;all the science and all the unknown answers its searching for&#xA;are all saying the same thing&#xA;because we are thinking about it in one lens&#xA;but as soon as we get down to the particle layer&#xA;the lens itself switches,&#xA;the observer creates the reality of the particle,&#xA;as soon as we enter the quantum worlds,&#xA;the laws change&#xA;we cannot measure things in the same way&#xA;the same things don&amp;rsquo;t apply&#xA;quantum entanglement, string theory,&#xA;quantum field theory,&#xA;all say the the same thing,&#xA;that the time we feel is not real like we imagine,&#xA;this does not mean we cant imagine it&#xA;we just have to imagine beyond the reality that we created,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;we rate our suffering on the basis of external experience,&#xA;peoples life conditions, money situation, and trama,&#xA;however there is suffering in having everything&#xA;a kind of suffer we don&amp;rsquo;t know how to talk bad out because&#xA;its so recent in human history that such large sums&#xA;of people had have their needs mets and live in worlds&#xA;where are  their needs are met for them&#xA;this suburban situation is having its first time in history&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;we use time&#xA;to define time,&#xA;an idea we created&#xA;has now created itself into us&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;everything we do&#xA;is in reference to time&#xA;our conscious experience is in a calculative dance&#xA;with the time thats moving around us&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we want to do the most with it,&#xA;we want to make some prof of it,&#xA;we want cash in our hands to know&#xA;our time has value&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and the numbers give us the prof of the value of the time,&#xA;they give us meaning, they give us food on our table.&#xA;through numbers we survive&#xA;so it makes sense that we give them a lot of credit&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time is art &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and like art, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;its value goes up with time, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The further we get away from the origin of creation, &#xA;The more deeply we value its existence &#xA;When we create with time, &#xA;allowing it to take us over, &#xA;The value of our time deepens, &#xA;Seconds become more meaningful, &#xA;And the essence of the day is imbued, &#xA;with the building an inner kingdom, &#xA;Let the frequency dig deeper, &#xA;The waves of experience craved further into the walls,&#xA;We let creation through us &#xA;We let it take over, &#xA;We become the thread, &#xA;Conciseness rides its way through the reflections &#xA;And threaded through so that the time &#xA;Unfolds, it grows and stacks in circles,&#xA;And cycles, patterns, meaning and senses &#xA;Are engaged and tapped into an activate &#xA;Process &#xA;Time is art&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Underneath the sea of infinite scrolling is the desire to give our time away and make it worth something to someone else. We share stuff and cool moments and all sides of our life and what we are saying underneath the surface is I want to take your time, I want to get your attention. We are taking something from each other with this need to entertain, we are feeding our friends, followers, and the world we love, with more and more information. Maybe this information is helpful, but is it helpful that we provoke others to rely on these screens to receive what we need? and what are we taking from their experience by providing this entertainment?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;time is how we make sense of our world.&#xA;time creates the structures, the systems, and the systems within the systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;time makes all the worlds go round and grow.&#xA;time is growing at different rates within different worlds.&#xA;time is growing at different rates within the worlds inside us&#xA;time is happening at multiple layers at once&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we are comprehending different layers of time at the same time&#xA;we can listen to different layers of time inside us&#xA;different time layers carry different visions&#xA;and different memories,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;we will go insane&#xA;before we let it make sense&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;it would collapse the&#xA;mental frame work of everything&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;all this mental frame work&#xA;is supporting an idea,&#xA;and all it takes is for that idea&#xA;to mean something completely different&lt;br&gt;&#xA;for all the frame work to collapse&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;time is an invention&#xA;that creates the experience&#xA;that this world is happening&#xA;outside of ourself&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;time provokes our perception&#xA;to seek for numerical validation&#xA;to make sense of itself&lt;/p&gt;</description>
