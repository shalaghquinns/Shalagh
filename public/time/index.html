      <p>everything is happening inside itself</p>
<p>all the science and all the unknown answers its searching for
are all saying the same thing
because we are thinking about it in one lens
but as soon as we get down to the particle layer
the lens itself switches,
the observer creates the reality of the particle,
as soon as we enter the quantum worlds,
the laws change
we cannot measure things in the same way
the same things don&rsquo;t apply
quantum entanglement, string theory,
quantum field theory,
all say the the same thing,
that the time we feel is not real like we imagine,
this does not mean we cant imagine it
we just have to imagine beyond the reality that we created,</p>

they give us meaning, they give us food on our table.
through numbers we survive

The more deeply we value its existence 
When we create with time, 
allowing it to take us over, 
The value of our time deepens, 
Seconds become more meaningful, 
And the essence of the day is imbued, 
with the building an inner kingdom, 
Let the frequency dig deeper, 
The waves of experience craved further into the walls,
We let creation through us 
We let it take over, 
We become the thread, 
Conciseness rides its way through the reflections 
And threaded through so that the time 
Unfolds, it grows and stacks in circles,
And cycles, patterns, meaning and senses 
Are engaged and tapped into an activate 
Process 
Time is art</p>

      <p>Underneath the sea of infinite scrolling is the desire to give our time away and make it worth something to someone else. We share stuff and cool moments and all sides of our life and what we are saying underneath the surface is I want to take your time, I want to get your attention. We are taking something from each other with this need to entertain, we are feeding our friends, followers, and the world we love, with more and more information. Maybe this information is helpful, but is it helpful that we provoke others to rely on these screens to receive what we need? and what are we taking from their experience by providing this entertainment?</p>
