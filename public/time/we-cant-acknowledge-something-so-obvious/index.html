before we let it make sense</p>
<p>it would collapse the
mental frame work of everything</p>
<p>all this mental frame work
is supporting an idea,
and all it takes is for that idea
to mean something completely different<br>
for all the frame work to collapse</p>
<p>time is an invention
that creates the experience
that this world is happening
outside of ourself</p>
<p>time provokes our perception
to seek for numerical validation
to make sense of itself</p>
<p>time gives a frame
that we use as a known reference point</p>
<p>time appears as a number,
so we want to add it up and make sense</p>
<p>time helps us keep track so that we can know
whats going on,</p>
<p>time creates the experience
that we know whats going on.</p>
<p><em>every time had a frame,</em>
<em>and all the clocks were hung on walls,</em>
<em>but time wasn&rsquo;t watching you keeping track</em>
<em>but time was on the floor</em></p>
<p><strong>The sacrifice of knowing the time</strong></p>
<p>we use time
to define time,
an idea we created
has now created itself into us</p>
<p>everything we do
is in reference to time
our conscious experience is in a calculative dance
with the time thats moving around us</p>
<p>we want to do the most with it,
we want to make some prof of it,
we want cash in our hands to know
our time has value</p>
<p>and the numbers give us the prof of the value of the time,
they give us meaning, they give us food on our table.
through numbers we survive
so it makes sense that we give them a lot of credit</p>
<p>but in many cases,
we give the numbers priority
over another voice
choosing the known
over the unknown
on some level sacrificing
a part of ourself
that we might know
or might never know</p>
<p><em>time is running</em>
<em>inside</em>
<em>not on a line</em></p>
<p>everything was always deepening,
since you got here all you&rsquo;ve been doing,
is making more and more sense of your world</p>
<p>each moment adds on each other,
as you go deeper as deeper inside
but thats not how we make it seem</p>
<p>the story we tell about our world is much more linear,</p>
<p><strong>films:</strong>
<strong>the reflection of our world,</strong>
<strong>our reflection of time</strong></p>
<p>films are always a reflection of the time they came from,
when they are released films mirror current issues in the world,
certain themes, characters and story lines that are relevant of the time,
the quality of video and special effects also mirrors the time period
the film was created and released,</p>
<p>the films we watch mimic the world we are in,
the screen is a reflection of the world we exist in,
so we turn to the screen on how to see how existence behaves
and then reference these behaviours as a standard in real life,
ie if someone on television does it,
I can too.</p>
<p>we watch so many movies and films,
that we believe life operates in a similar way,
that things are suppose to happen on a linear time line,</p>
<p>as we watch the screen,
and then watch our world,
hoping to be fed it in a way that makes sense,
just like the movies,
and then forgot,
that we&rsquo;re the ones who have to
make our own sense of this place.</p>
<p><strong>our imagination got lazy</strong></p>
<p>anything we could ever imagine
we have access to in seconds
&hellip;</p>
<p>numbers gave the meaning feeling
but the meaning ain&rsquo;t real
so the feeling ain&rsquo;t either</p>
<p><em>this is a world without lines,</em>
<em>not one thing is defined,</em></p>
<p><strong>what money did to time</strong></p>
<p>in a world where everything was just a
reflection of everything else
everything had become separated
with a definition
anyways that wasn&rsquo;t the point,
what mattered is we created systems from this seperation,
that divided up an experience that was never divided</p>
<p>its just very unnatural
and the repercussions
have created a situation that
makes no sense</p>
<p>their are so many numbers involved,
facts, articles, information and sides to consider
about the ways money had divided up the world
and created so many problems impossible to conceive
the only conclusion we can draw is that
all this money
came from our perception of time</p>
<p>how can you make
your time
your money</p>
<p>thats the game on earth.
thats how we got here</p>
<p>money and time
are in an open relationship
constantly feeding off each other
to maintain the experience
that this external reality
that is providing for us</p>
<p>as money gives us our survival needs,
we give it our time.
but the exchange isn&rsquo;t fair,
this is the great inequality</p>
<p>some people get shit all for their time,
and some people are paid hella,
this is motivates us,
this moves us,
we want to make the most from our time</p>
<p>we go to great lengths
to celebrate and maintain the image,
that we get the most from our time,
we work to prove to ourself and others
that we knew what we were doing</p>
<p>but time had no idea what it was doing
thats not why it was moving
time was just creating itself further into itself</p>
<p>time had reached
a point in time
that it had created
everything time could
have ever imagined
and now it was time
to imagine a time
without itself</p>
<p>the greatest gift on earth
time</p>
<p>once we are unable to find solace in the external world
we have no where to turn but inside
this world is loosing its ability to be made sense of</p>
<p>use it up, so we are using u our experience on earth,</p>
<p>unfortunately
no more external issues can be addressed,
everything we need to change
is being born from within
each of us.</p>
<p>this is all none sense,
added up with a bunch of numbers,
but its still all nonsense,
and its not your responsibility to make sense of it</p>
<p>your responsibility
is your response ability, and this does not include all the problems of the world,
but it does put a-lot of attention into your inner experience and implication
that you are the only</p>
<p>but none of it was actually what we valued
it was just the definations we used to value stuff,
but we had become more drawn to the defintion of value
than the sense that it created internally.</p>
