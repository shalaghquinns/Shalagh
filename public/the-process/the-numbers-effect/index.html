numbers have created multiple streams in this shared reality
that cause us to rely on validate, and make sense of our time through their systems</p>
<p>This piece explores the rise in popularity and reliance on numbers, and our slowly built dependancy on this created system. We will see how the use of numbers came to ripple so deeply into the collective psych and the way we form, comprehend and understand reality. Numbers are not just used to plan our time, and give us a salary, they carry an energy of certainty, of calculation, and of validating our self.</p>
<p><em>Before infinity</em></p>
<p>Before this modern world, filled with millions of possibilities and infinite ways to make and use numbers, our sphere of focus was contained into the world around us, meeting our basic needs so we could survive. Our lives were simpler, we dealt with problems we don&rsquo;t deal with today. We did not have the possibility to participate in infinite ways to do what we wanted with our time.</p>
<p>For the first time in world history, there is the largest population in the history of earth, with the ability to do what they want with their time. Not simply put as the time is free, but we are no longer constrained to having our basic needs met. Time has opened up in to infinite options for possibility.</p>
<p>We were caught under the grips of nature, under the grips of war, under the grips of religion, of famine, and now we are caught under a new kind of grip.</p>
<p>The grip of illusion. As real as money seems, and as real as the things it can buy us are. Money keeps us living in money, money keeps us spending our time making money, and money can&rsquo;t buy what we are looking for inside.</p>
<p>I believe our search for money is in a search for trust. We don&rsquo;t really want money, we want to believe we are supported for. We want to trust that what we have inside, and what we have to bring to the world, is enough to be here. When we label what we have to give to a number, we are labeling our value. We are seeing ourself through the box of that value, and planning our life around it.</p>
<p>The journey I have taken in my life is to discover if I can trust the process of my work coming out of me in the world. Let it take me where I feel, let it be my focus, let it come out of me, give it to the world, and watch it support me.</p>
<p>Since engaging this sense of trust 7 years ago I have been taken on a wild journey throughout the world that has taught me side of myself i needed to see to bring my vision to life.
My vision was an idea, i can trust the process of my work. This vision was meant to teach me a lesson about time.</p>
<p>something i&rsquo;ve known since before I can remember;
I came to say something to the world about time.</p>
<p>The vision came when I was 23
it told me
enjoy the process
of learning about myself,
in everything I do.</p>
<p>and I have a gift if you can trust me</p>
<p>The gift was the process and all the ways it taught me how I am holding myself back.
The process showed me all the ways I try to plan, and look good, and seek known results.
It helped me to release my plans, and surrender, and the process brought me the most amazing people to teach me everything I needed to learn.
The process brought me to amazing places to paint walls, it was with me in every stroke I ever made, every colour I ever choose.
The process was with me every time i&rsquo;ve sat outside drawing portraits, trusting the pen on the page, trusting the people I meet.
The process was there every day for the past 7 years where I have had no plans, and just followed my body. The process came through my body
Now this is what i want to share, and continue to share.</p>
<p>It stems from a fear in the unknown, which was instilled into our species a long time ago. The awareness of death, was all it took to form the need for religion. Once the belief systems spread, an order began. An order centred around our most human experience, our most vital truth, our most vulnerable position; we will be taken from this earth, and we don&rsquo;t know where we will go.</p>
<p>Religion instilled fear into death, the fear of a hell with no escape. Religion offered hope the promise of a heaven way beyond what was found on earth. This turned death into a beautiful place to be, and earth as the working stage to achieve something we can not find while we are here.</p>
<p><em>Number Revolution</em></p>
<p>As science eventually rained on religions collective parade, the fear of death did not go away, it just became something we could measure.</p>
<p>Science transformed the world into numbers and the Copernicus revolution flipped humanity in on itself - we would no longer believe what was not proved to be real. Numbers became the religion, the only way we could prove anything to be real. Slowly the numbers got stronger and powerful as they revealed more proof, more patterns, more inventions, and more physical reality than ever before seen. The industrial revolutions slow transition into the technology revolution, was bridged through the collective ability to do more and more with our time through the systems created by numbers.</p>
<p>Fast forward to modern day and numbers move everything. Numbers from the basis for the way we make sense of our reality, both literally and metaphorically. They shape both the real and the not real, the conscious and unconscious, the known and the unknown, all forms of experience are shaped by calculating numbers.</p>
<p>All plans begin with a foundation or consideration of money, and amount of time taken. Amount of money spent, amount of money lost from not working, amount of money saved for the unknown. Money is not what is always on our mind, but the things that are on our mind, most often contain an awareness of money in them. When we see our time though the lens of money we train ourself to contain the world into illusionary boxes of possibility.</p>
<p>Our phones are designed to take our time as a form of number of likes and follows. We see the moments as a possibility for more numbers, we want to capture it because the possibility of more numbers equal more numbers, which would apparently equal a greater value of time.</p>
<p>We are not trained or told to make decisions with considering the time and numbers. We are advertised by these companies to follow our dreams, but its to buy a product that must follow a very specific dream to attain. The collective dream, the collective story, is of the person that comes to earth to make money, to make the most amount of money from our time, and then to form our reality around that. Nothing comes without this base.</p>
<p>However, when we have achieved some from of free time after our heroic quest for enough money was a success, we&rsquo;re stuck with the question of what to do with free time. So we spend it doing the things we like to do. These things we like to do that we push to the side and save for the time were were a comfortable doing them, they want to be to the center of your world, they want to be what the world is create upon, but when we have created our world, through the system the was designed for us, we always feel we are missing something, but and this turns out to be correct.</p>
<p><em>Inside Numbers</em></p>
<p>When you form your world from the inside of it, than the experience you&rsquo;re having inside begins to show up in time and in reality. Your&rsquo;e reality is a mirror, when we look to the mirror outside to create the world, we are functioning within a made up system that we believe is real. When we turn to an inner system, we are also functioning on a made up system that we believe is real, but this time because we believe its real it becomes it.</p>
